Also pictured: Donald Trump. | AP photo composite by POLITICO Trump on Prejean: Same as Obama\n\nPresident Barack Obama ended up in the middle of an unlikely controversy this morning \u2014 the debate over Miss California\u2019s position on gay marriage.\n\nAt a press conference addressing Carrie Prejean\u2019s disputed title in the Miss USA competition, pageant owner Donald Trump compared Prejean\u2019s stated views on gay marriage to Obama\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt's the same answer that the president of the United States gave,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe gave an honorable answer. She gave an answer from her heart.\u201d\n\nIn her own remarks moments later, Prejean echoed Trump\u2019s statement, telling reporters: \u201cThe president of the United States, the secretary of state, and many Americans agree with me in this belief.\u201d\n\nIn the final round of the Miss USA pageant, Prejean told judge Perez Hilton: \u201cI think in my country, in my family, I think that I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a woman. No offense to anybody out there, but that's how I was raised.\u201d", "images": ["https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/116f0a1/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-origin-images.politico.com%2Fnews%2F090512_trumpobama_comp2.jpg", "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/news/090512_trumpobama_comp2.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/news/090512_trumpobama_comp2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexander Burns"], "canonical_link": "https://www.politico.com/story/2009/05/trump-on-prejean-same-as-obama-022413", "title": "Trump on Prejean: Same as Obama", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "brightspot.contentId": "0000014e-a93e-df19-a1ee-bf7e50ac0015", "og": {"title": "Trump on Prejean: Same as Obama", "description": "Obama ends up in middle of an unlikely controversy &mdash; the debate over Miss California&rsquo;s position on gay marriage.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2009/05/trump-on-prejean-same-as-obama-022413", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/news/090512_trumpobama_comp2.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "site_name": "POLITICO"}, "description": "Obama ends up in middle of an unlikely controversy &mdash; the debate over Miss California&rsquo;s position on gay marriage.", "keywords": "miss california,gop,miss america,opposite marriage", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@politico", "creator": "@politico"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "host": "www.politico.com", "build": "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1242120375.0, "source": "http://www.politico.com", "summary": ""}
