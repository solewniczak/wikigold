If you can, please contribute to Geller Report.\n\nSubscribe to Geller Report newsletter here \u2014 it\u2019s free and it\u2019s critical NOW when informed decision making and opinion is essential to America's survival. Share our posts on your social channels and with your email contacts. Fight the great fight.\n\nQuick note: Tech giants are shutting us down. You know this. Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Adsense, Pinterest permanently banned us. Facebook, Google search et al have shadow-banned, suspended and deleted us from your news feeds. They are disappearing us. But we are here. We will not waver. We will not tire. We will not falter, and we will not fail. Freedom will prevail.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising. The left hates our freedoms, and so designating the Declaration of Independence, the most magnificent document in all of human history, as hate speech is in line with their agenda. The left means to criminalize lawfulness. The left means to criminalize freedom of speech. The left means to criminalize individual rights. The left means to criminalize Americanism.\n\nWhat must have seemed like a benign social media strategy managed to fall foul of Facebook\u2019s algorithmic censors, which labeled sections of the declaration hate speech and removed the posts.\n\nThe Truth Must be Told\n\nYour contribution supports independent journalism\n\nPlease take a moment to consider this. Now, more than ever, people are reading Geller Report for news they won't get anywhere else. But advertising revenues have all but disappeared. Google Adsense is the online advertising monopoly and they have banned us. Social media giants like Facebook and Twitter have blocked and shadow-banned our accounts. But we won't put up a paywall. Because never has the free world needed independent journalism more.\n\nEveryone who reads our reporting knows the Geller Report covers the news the media won't. We cannot do our ground-breaking report without your support. We must continue to report on the global jihad and the left's war on freedom. Our readers\u2019 contributions make that possible.\n\nGeller Report's independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our work is critical in the fight for freedom and because it is your fight, too.", "images": ["https://eadn-wc02-4988931.nxedge.io/cdn/wp-content/themes/pamela-geller/assets/img/samples/ground-zero-mosque.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20260%20343'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20217'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201240%20744'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://eadn-wc02-4988931.nxedge.io/cdn/wp-content/themes/pamela-geller/assets/img/samples/stoptheislamizationofamerica.jpg", "https://eadn-wc02-4988931.nxedge.io/cdn/wp-content/themes/pamela-geller/assets/img/logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20190%20284'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20227%20222'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://b1ff5939f6.nxcli.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-12-at-9.47.08-AM.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20362%20500'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20250%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://b1ff5939f6.nxcli.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/foudning.jpg", "http://b1ff5939f6.nxcli.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Whatfinger250x2505.jpg", "https://eadn-wc02-4988931.nxedge.io/cdn/wp-content/themes/pamela-geller/assets/img/samples/pap-book.jpeg", "http://b1ff5939f6.nxcli.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cwtat-1-225x300.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20582%20106'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20810%20176'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://b1ff5939f6.nxcli.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-4.58.46-PM-800x271.png", "https://eadn-wc02-4988931.nxedge.io/cdn/wp-content/themes/pamela-geller/assets/img/samples/cantwetalkabouthis.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://eadn-wc02-4988931.nxedge.io/cdn/wp-content/themes/pamela-geller/assets/img/samples/fatwa-hunted-in-america.jpg", "https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif", "https://c.statcounter.com/12365610/0/9d63e1d3/1/", "http://b1ff5939f6.nxcli.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/afdi-logo.jpg", "http://b1ff5939f6.nxcli.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/commentary-1-216x300.jpg", "https://eadn-wc02-4988931.nxedge.io/cdn/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/share-to-parler.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20345%20499'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://eadn-wc02-4988931.nxedge.io/cdn/wp-content/themes/pamela-geller/assets/img/samples/ground-zero-mosque.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Pamela Geller", "Sam Wolfson", "In The Run-Up To The Fourth Of July", "The Liberty Country Vindicator", "A Small Local Newspaper In Texas", "Posted Sections Of The Declaration Of The Independence To Its"], "canonical_link": "https://gellerreport.com/2018/07/facebook-declaration-independence-hate-speech.html/", "title": "Facebook removes, censors Declaration of Independence as \u2018hate speech\u2019 \u2013 Geller Report", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://gellerreport.com", "summary": ""}
