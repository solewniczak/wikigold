It\u2019s all so clear now,\u201d he added.\n\nAfter the video started to go viral in ISIS cave networks and strongholds, thousands of terrorists began pouring out into the streets of Mayadin, giving one another spontaneous group hugs, destroying their weapons, and planting trees and flowers in an attempt to begin rebuilding the Middle East into a utopian wonderland.\n\nAccording to reports, al-Baghdadi further confirmed that a recent advertisement in which Kendall Jenner offered a group of riot police a Pepsi was also influential in his decision to immediately cease their murderous reign of terror and lead ISIS down a path of peace.", "images": ["https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10068-1-thumb.jpg", "http://babylonbee.com/img/logo-dark.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=326751097945685&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10594-2-thumb.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10674-2-thumb.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10668-1-thumb.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10681-2-thumb.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-1711-thumb.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-1219-thumb.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-7624-1-thumb.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-8314-1-thumb.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1000.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-5786-1-thumb.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-930-thumb.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-7280-2-thumb.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-1145-thumb.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-777-thumb.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-10672-1-thumb.jpg", "https://media.babylonbee.com/thumbs/article-207-thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://babylonbee.com/news/isis-lays-arms-katy-perrys-impassioned-plea-like-just-co-exist", "title": "ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry's Impassioned Plea To 'Like, Just Co-Exist'", "meta_data": {"hidePermissionToggle": 1, "generatorComments": "[\"I thought this was supposed to be satire!\",\"You used to be good, but now you just do lame Christian stuff.\",\"I miss Adam Ford.\",\"I usually like satire, but this time you've gone too far!\",\"This ain't it, chief.\",\"Can we get a fact-check here, Snopes?\",\"Ok, boomer.\",\"How dare you!\",\"Do better.\",\"Wait, is this real?\",\"Conservatives only have two jokes.\",\"This would be funny if it weren't so true!\",\"You used to be good, but now you just do lame political stuff.\",\"You used to be good, but now you\\u2019re just a Trump hating rag.\",\"You used to be good, but now you\\u2019re just a right-wing hating rag.\",\"You used to be good, but now you\\u2019re just lazy.\",\"Too political.\",\"Too soon!\",\"There's no way that this is true!\",\"I don't get it.\",\"Didn't this start out as a satire site?\",\"I'm just here for the comments.\",\"Reported.\",\"At least Hillary's not president.\",\"Racist!\",\"I know this is satire, but it's still dangerous.\",\"But wait, didn't this actually happen?\",\"I don\\u2019t think that this is the subject to try to satirize.
