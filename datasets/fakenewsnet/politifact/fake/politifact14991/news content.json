Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was \u201cbuilt by immigrants.\u201d\n\nFact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE\n\nWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not \u201cimmigrants\u201d but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/02/GettyImages-1270690504-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/03/imgonline-com-ua-FrameBlurred-3k0bUBjKiKTC-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/03/Sarah-Stier_Getty-Images-10-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/03/Texas-Border-Wall-Panels-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/10/SPM-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/03/Chinese-Fighter-Jets-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/09/putin4-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/03/BARR-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/08/718-chris-murphy-d-ct-ap-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/02/Getty-Images_Carmen-Mandato-4-200x150.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/03/Biden-Blames-Putin-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/03/GettyImages-1353351705-inset-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/03/ad94cc_russia-germany-13219-vladimir-putin-russian-president-vladimir-putin-e1527007739280-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/07/gas-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/07/Claire-McCaskill--200x150.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/03/Adeyemo-314-Thumbnail-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/AP_18318222465634-1-200x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/01/Russian-President-Vladimir-Putin-Receives-Friendship-Medal-In-Beijing-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/03/Tulsi-Gabbard-Mitt-Romney-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/03/Attack-Yonkers-Police-Department-200x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "description": "Rep.
