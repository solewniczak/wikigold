In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that\u2019s not what got him in trouble.\n\nAfter the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:\n\n\u201cNo, man. I don\u2019t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin\u2019 that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That\u2019s not violence\u2026it\u2019s survival of the species.\u201d\n\nThe reporter, Glen Dingusman, immediately contacted the Secret Service with his evidence of violent threats made against the president and Snoop Dogg, who was on his way into a restaurant for lunch when the exchange happened, never made it past his hot wing appetizer.\n\nAccording to the agency, he will be held as a military combatant without being charged until they can ascertain whether or not he\u2019s a threat to the president. At the very least, this should teach him and some other dumb liberals a good lesson about what happens in Trump\u2019s America if you say and do stupid crap.\n\n[Via Stryker]", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI0MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI0MCIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDQwIDQwIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBmaWxsPSIjY2ZkNGRiIi8+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D", "data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 192 108'%2F%3E", "https://www.huzlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/huzlerslogo.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=244902324179533&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.huzlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/maxresdefault.jpeg?fit=1280%2C720&ssl=1", "data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 364 205'%2F%3E", "data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 1280 720'%2F%3E"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.huzlers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/maxresdefault.jpeg?fit=1280%2C720&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.huzlers.com/snoop-dogg-arrested-conspiracy-talking-murder-trump-video/", "title": "Snoop Dogg Arrested For Conspiracy After Talking About His \u2018Murder Trump\u2019 Video", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 197954230771450}, "theme-color": "#000000", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "application-name": "Snoop Dogg Arrested For Conspiracy After Talking About His \u2018Murder Trump\u2019 Video", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Snoop Dog...", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "default", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "ETpYWsM4T-QrGU6gAcAEkJBHhy8NLKsW3nps0pR5OCk", "msvalidate.01": "2467D949F4E211598A9ACAABFFC3BDFE", "yandex-verification": "8bb7da0ca86e21b4", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, height=device-height, width=device-width", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Snoop Dogg Arrested For Conspiracy After Talking About His \u2018Murder Trump\u2019 Video", "description": "Snoop Dogg, major pothead and advocate of violence as a form of protest, has landed in hot water over his video \u201cLavender,\u201d in which he shoots Donald Trump.
