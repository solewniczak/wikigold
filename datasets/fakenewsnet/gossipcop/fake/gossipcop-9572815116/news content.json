Many media outlets have speculated that the former Friends star might be getting back together with her ex, Brad Pitt, since he too is single after splitting from Angelina Jolie. In fact, there have been so many rumors about Aniston's love life that it should come as no surprise that a new rumor has begun circulating which has the actress in a \"fight\" over Katy Perry's on-again/off-again beau, Orlando Bloom.\n\nIn what is said to be an exclusive from RadarOnline, the media outlet shared that a source who is apparently friends with Jennifer Aniston has revealed that at the top of the actress' list of apparent crushes is Bloom, and she is also \"very open about wanting to hit the dating scene.\" The site also claims that even though it seems as if Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom are back together again, that is not necessarily going to stop Aniston, after the apparent connection they established with each other \"years ago.\"\n\nHowever, while RadarOnline might be reporting that if Jennifer Aniston were to go after Bloom, she may have a fight on her hands from Perry, according to Gossip Cop, this is actually false. Instead, the outlet which is known for debunking many Hollywood rumors indicated that Aniston has no intention of going after Orlando Bloom.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d7bb3a79-5556-4b77-95b6-1e7023672181.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/W4tCBPELsZJiig5WwEg6.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4a918df6a9bd9504e87608b20d87cb49?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fed4959c-fb17-4183-9a69-aa4c161aa162.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/9e1eeba9-a8c9-4dbf-bf8e-15ed56ed5931.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4826781/jennifer-aniston-and-katy-perry-not-fighting-over-orlando-bloom-according-to-gossip-cop/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston And Katy Perry Not Fighting Over Orlando Bloom, According To 'Gossip Cop'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Aniston And Katy Perry Not Fighting Over Orlando Bloom, According To 'Gossip Cop'", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4826781/jennifer-aniston-and-katy-perry-not-fighting-over-orlando-bloom-according-to-gossip-cop/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Jennifer Aniston And Katy Perry Not Fighting Over Orlando Bloom, According To 'Gossip Cop'", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-03-15 09:30:04Z", "section": "Fact Checking"}, "description": "Jennifer Aniston And Katy Perry Not Fighting Over Orlando Bloom, According To 'Gossip Cop'", "keywords": "Fact Checking", "news_keywords": "Fact Checking", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521106204.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
