The pair had a date night on Monday at Il Marino di Puntaldia just two days before the first birthday of their twins, Alexander and Ella.\n\nHe's clutching her hand, and she's wearing a beautiful dragon print dress, while he wore a stylish blue polo shirt with striped pants. While the lovely couple always garners plenty of attention, one thing, in particular, stood out to fans in this picture. Followers quickly pointed out that Amal sported what might be a tiny baby bump in the image.\n\nInstagram user andreal_pez asked, \"Is she pregnant again???\" Of course, another fan had another possible explanation. A poster with the username carefullycuratedcloset said, \"Does she look a bit preggers or [is] she just having one of THOSE days like the rest of us do??\"\n\nIt would entirely be horrifying to see pictures of yourself after date night, and immediately see speculation of a possible pregnancy when the truth is you merely sported a food baby after some delicious food.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d7bb3a79-5556-4b77-95b6-1e7023672181.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/YkO9RX7cDoMm6hx5W74a.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/W4tCBPELsZJiig5WwEg6.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/42196c046e4a2503f7f937da1575ba1c?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fed4959c-fb17-4183-9a69-aa4c161aa162.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/George-Clooney-Amal-Clooney-Pregnant.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/George-Clooney-Amal-Clooney-Pregnant.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4929733/is-amal-clooney-pregnant-fans-spot-maybe-baby-bump-in-new-pic/", "title": "Is Amal Clooney Pregnant?
