The author goes to great lengths to infiltrate many organisations including the psychiatric hospital where Jolie stayed as an inpatient, to discover the truth about this famous couple. While the book is heavily centred on Jolie (with Pitt starring more in a supporting role- perhaps because his background is rather more typical and therefore, less interesting) I thought the book was very fair on both of them- it doesn't refute the fact that they are both talented, intelligent and loving parents devoted to their humanitarian causes, but it does debunk alot of the saccharin rubbish that is continually pumped out by their PR. For example, I laughed at Halperin's description of how they refuse to allow their nannies to be photographed when they are all on family outings to give the impression that they do everything for the kids when its blatently obvious that noone- not even a superwoman, could look after 6 children, do back to back movies and travel with UNICEF all at the same time. It also emphasised the downside of their fame mentioning how shiloh referred to her nanny as \"mummy\" as she spent most of her time with her instead of Jolie.\n\n\n\nMuch is also made of their philanthropic efforts but then, surely if you have as much wealth as they do, you would have to have a heart of stone and no social conscience whatsoever to see the horrific poverty in Africa and other parts of the world and then spend $5,000 on a handbag. I just like this book for debunking the myth that celebrities are perfect when in fact they hire PR and management specifically to manipulate the press and to portray a certain image- most of it is smoke and mirrors. After all, if this book was truly slanderous then why didn't they sue?\n\nI just think this book balances out the hollywood hype and shows us that celebrities have their own issues, problems and sruggles just like the rest of us.", "images": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/gno/sprites/nav-sprite-global-1x-hm-dsk-reorg._CB405937547_.png", "https://assoc-na.associates-amazon.com/abid/um?s=142-0618185-5443316&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/US-hq/2021/img/Amazon_Exports/XCM_CUTTLE_1351597_1786068_US_650x45_en_US._CB645630042_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514x53RdYUL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21m2Gt2n+zL._SY600_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41fFjCcrpHL._AC_SX60_CR,0,0,60,60_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/amazonbookclub/ABC_logo_primary_beta._CB408510813_.svg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/app/QR-store-link-kindle-app._CB626291935_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/transparent-pixel._V192234675_.gif", "http://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:142-0618185-5443316:QGA6V89R9FC0NS2TRMKD$uedata=s:%2Frd%2Fuedata%3Fnoscript%26id%3DQGA6V89R9FC0NS2TRMKD:0", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41fFjCcrpHL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_ML2_.jpg", "http://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:142-0618185-5443316:QGA6V89R9FC0NS2TRMKD$uedata=s:%2Frd%2Fuedata%3Fstaticb%26id%3DQGA6V89R9FC0NS2TRMKD:0", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Audible/Homestead/logo/audiblelogo._CB482869198_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/amazonbookclub/chooseBooksImage._CB409113671_.svg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/amazonbookclub/joinClubsImage._CB409113671_.svg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/app/kindle-app-logo._CB668847749_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51aTl7RQRUL._AC_SX60_CR,0,0,60,60_.jpg", "https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/personalization/ybh/loading-4x-gray._CB485916920_.gif", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/a1f72a2a-b8d1-497a-a439-69640a4df328._CR0,0,105,105_UX110_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31r0fQKnusL._AC_SX60_CR,0,0,60,60_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/amazonbookclub/scheduleWithEaseImage._CB409113670_.svg"], "top_img": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/app/QR-store-link-kindle-app._CB626291935_.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Halperin", "Follow The Author", "Abqa"], "canonical_link": "https://www.amazon.com/Brangelina-Untold-Story-Angelina-Jolie/dp/0981239668", "title": "Brangelina: The Untold Story of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie: Halperin, Ian: 9780981239668: Amazon.com: Books", "meta_data": {"description": "Brangelina: The Untold Story of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie [Halperin, Ian] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers.
