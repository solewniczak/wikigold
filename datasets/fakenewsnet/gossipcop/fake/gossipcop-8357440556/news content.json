Simpson\u2019s Kids Spotted in the Days Following His Release from Prison\n\nNew photos have surfaced of O.J. Simpson's children following his release from prison.\n\nBackgrid O.J. walked out of Nevada's Lovelock Correctional Center a free man Sunday after serving nine years for kidnapping, armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nDespite reports O.J. might try to return to Florida, the AP says Simpson plans to stay in the Las Vegas area for the foreseeable future. It seems his eldest daughter Arnelle, from his first marriage to Marguerite Whitley, is there to support him. The 48-year-old also spoke out on his behalf at his parole hearing in July.\n\nBackgrid Arnelle was spotted shopping at a local TJ Maxx, Stein Mart and Burlington Coat Factory before picking up groceries at Trader Joe's.\n\nMeanwhile, his son Justin, from his marriage to Nicole Brown Simpson, seems to be keeping his distance. The 29-year-old was photographed working in St. Petersburg, Florida. According to Splash, the realtor took off in his pickup truck when he was questioned about his father's release.\n\nSplash O.J.'s other children, Jason, 47, from his marriage to Marguerite, and Sydney, 31, from his marriage to Nicole, have managed to stay out of the spotlight so far.", "images": ["https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/fa/4by3/2021/11/23/fae85da7286f4759bd2da9201f937066_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/81/o/2017/10/03/8150d97e703f5c28b525574fbf11a757_md.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/ec/5by6/2022/03/15/ec918c4be1424eb7b3785b453ec08c0f_md.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/51/5by6/2022/03/14/512ee192fa664a2d9c44cae5b8fa3b5e_md.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/53/4by3/2022/03/14/5399688b459f45fb86590296f963c5ec_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/11/5by6/2022/02/08/115b630d2c1947b7bbde5210a42d8402_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/14/4by3/2022/02/15/1431fbc397a2491c8b295c6443ff8d00_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/38/5by6/2022/03/01/380d39ef25c44bc48c9548a55bee0bab_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/21/3by2/2017/10/01/21aab06e22975d689b4ea722a71e1cc3_xs.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/aa/3by2/2017/08/18/aa49bd00f371572e8598bbd8a66dbc81_xs.jpg", "https://static.extratv.com/extra-web/img/logos/extra-logo-v1.svg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/51/5by6/2022/03/07/518fe36d810245c48aff8a61c253c9d5_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/15/o/2017/10/03/155575882b6750deb939480e75bb50cd_md.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/6f/3by2/2017/08/03/6fda85c327cf54bb974edb983c870b56_xs.png", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/09/5by6/2022/03/03/090d95bd099d4b8da6210b71c67c16aa_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/68/5by4/2016/02/23/68bb1d2dffee5ac08bcca32c4b7e0526_xs.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/9c/o/2017/10/03/9ced8defca3754e6ae328b3cd0b83412_md.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/e5/16by9/2017/10/03/e5d6b14111d156eaa0f8575556a8742f_xl.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/d2/4by3/2020/06/26/d258280ddf825b4f8e3e7a6db0702916_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/90/5by6/2022/02/16/904e9f2ff94f42ee8e6383c144cdb57c_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/32/5by6/2022/02/14/325e2276a5f24094af3e0b621663f53d_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/00/3by2/2022/02/01/00eda5001267499b9fd5f024686c19be_md.jpg"], "top_img": "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/e5/16by9/2017/10/03/e5d6b14111d156eaa0f8575556a8742f_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://extratv.com/2017/10/03/pics-o-j-simpsons-kids-spotted-in-the-days-following-his-release-from-prison/", "title": "Pics: O.J.
