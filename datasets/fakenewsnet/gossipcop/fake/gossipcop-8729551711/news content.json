In 1991, he released a self-titled debut album, charting four singles in Australia before moving to the United States the following year. He found work as a session guitarist before starting a band known as The Ranch, which recorded one studio album on Capitol Nashville and charted two singles on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.\n\nStill signed to Capitol, Urban made his solo American debut in 1999 with a second eponymous album. Certified platinum in the US by the RIAA, it produced his first number one on the Hot Country Songs chart with \"But for the Grace of God\". \"Somebody Like You\", the first single from his second Capitol album Golden Road (2002), was named by Billboard as the biggest country hit of the 2000s decade. The album's fourth single, \"You'll Think of Me\" featuring his nephew and country artist Rory Gilliatte, earned him his first Grammy Award. 2004's Be Here, his third American album became his highest-selling album, being certified 4\u00d7 Platinum. Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy Thing was released in 2006, containing \"Once in a Lifetime\" as well as his second Grammy Award-winning song, \"Stupid Boy\". A greatest hits package titled Greatest Hits: 18 Kids followed in late 2007. Defying Gravity and Get Closer were released on 31 March 2009 and 16 November 2010, respectively. In September 2013, he released the album Fuse, which produced four more number ones on the Country Airplay chart. \"John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16\" was released in June 2015 as the lead single of his eighth American studio album, Ripcord. The album later produced the Country Airplay chart number-one hits \"Break on Me\", \"Wasted Time\", and \"Blue Ain't Your Color\", with the latter also becoming Urban's longest-reigning number one on the Hot Country Songs chart, spending 12 weeks atop the chart. His tenth album, Graffiti U, was released in 2018 and includes the Top 10 hit \"Coming Home\". His eleventh album The Speed of Now Part 1 was released in 2020 and includes the global hit \"One Too Many\" with Pink, in addition to Country Airplay top ten hits \"We Were\" and \"God Whispered Your Name\".\n\nUrban has released a total of eleven studio albums (one of which was released only in Australia), as well as one album with The Ranch.

Those also include his third Grammy Award-winning single \"Sweet Thing\" from his album Defying Gravity.\n\nUrban is also known for his role as a coach on the Australian version of the singing competition The Voice and as a judge on American Idol. In October 2013, Urban introduced his own signature line of guitars and accessories.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nUrban was born on 26 October 1967 in Whangarei, New Zealand.[1] He is the youngest son of Marienne and Robert \"Bob\" Urbahn.[3] He later moved with his parents to Caboolture, Queensland, Australia.[when?] His father, who owned a convenience store, put an ad for a guitar teacher in his shop window.[6] Urban took lessons from his teacher, Sue McCarthy,[7] and began entering local competitions, in addition to acting in a local theatre company.[1] Urban has stated that his guitar playing was influenced by two rock players, Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits) and Lindsey Buckingham (Fleetwood Mac).\n\nIn 1983, Urban was a contestant on the Australian TV talent show New Faces.[8] A few years later, he began making inroads into the Australian country music scene, with regular appearances on the Reg Lindsay Country Homestead TV Program, Mike McClellan's Music Program, and various other TV programmes performing duets with local Brisbane girl Jenny Wilson. They won a Golden Guitar award at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. Urban also performed regularly on stage at the Northern Suburbs Country Music Club in Bald Hills, where he was a member. He was in a band called 'Kids Country', which performed during school holidays at various venues and made appearances on the Reg Lindsey show and Conway Country.\n\nMusical career [ edit ]\n\n1990\u20131999: Early years [ edit ]\n\nIn 1990, Urban signed with EMI in Australia and released his self-titled debut album.[1] He appeared on the 1990 compilation album Breaking Ground - New Directions in Country Music, which was nominated for the 1991 ARIA Award for Best Country Album.[9] He toured as a backup act to Slim Dusty between 1993 and 1994. In the mid-1990s, both people recorded a re-worked duet of Dusty's classic \"Lights on the Hill\". Urban appeared for the first time at the Grand Ole Opry backing Dusty.[10] He also sang backing vocals on INXS's 1991 single \"Shining Star\".[11]\n\nUrban moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1992. The next year, he appeared in the music video for Alan Jackson's rendition of \"Mercury Blues\".[12] He and Vernon Rust co-wrote \"Jesus Gets Jealous of Santa Claus\" on Toby Keith's 1995 album Christmas to Christmas,[13] 4 Runner's 1996 single \"That Was Him (This Is Now)\",[14], he played guitar on Garth Brooks' album Double Live (Garth Brooks album) and \"Tangled Up in Love\" on the Raybon Brothers' 1997 self-titled album.[15] In 1997, he formed a band known as The Ranch, which included drummer Peter Clarke and bassist Jerry Flowers. The Ranch released one self-titled album for Capitol Records Nashville and charted two singles on the Hot Country Songs charts that year: \"Walkin' the Country\" and \"Just Some Love\".[16] Throughout the late 1990s, Urban also played guitar on several other artists' albums, such as Paul Jefferson,[17] Tim Wilson, and Charlie Daniels.\n\n1999\u20132001: Keith Urban [ edit ]\n\nUrban released his self-titled American debut album in 1999 under the production of session pianist Matt Rollings. It was led by the number 18 single \"It's a Love Thing\", followed by the number four single \"Your Everything\", which made him the first male New Zealand performer to reach the Top 10 on the US country charts.[18] Its follow-up, \"But for the Grace of God\", written by Charlotte Caffey and Jane Wiedlin of The Go-Gos, became his first number 1 hit on the charts. The last single, \"Where the Blacktop Ends\", written by Steve Wariner and Allen Shamblin, went to number three. He won the Top New Male Vocalist Award at the 2001 Academy of Country Music Awards and the 2001 Country Music Association's Horizon Award. Allmusic's Thom Jurek described the first and third singles favorably, and praised the instrumental track \"Rollercoaster\", saying that Urban was \"flat picking his Stratocaster like it was another extremity he was born with.\" He thought that those songs \"balance the slick and sometimes too-soft production on the record\".[19]\n\n2002\u20132006: Golden Road & Be Here [ edit ]\n\nUrban in 2003\n\nUrban released his second American album Golden Road in 2002.

The second single was the number three hit \"Raining on Sunday\", which Radney Foster had previously released as a single from his 1998 album See What You Want to See.[21] The third and fourth singles from the album, \"Who Wouldn't Wanna Be Me\" and \"You'll Think of Me\", went to number one, with the latter winning him the Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 2005.[22]\n\nOn 22 September 2005, Urban's third studio album Golden Road was certified triple platinum, for sales of 3 million copies.[23]\n\nIn 2002, Urban posed nude for Playgirl. On the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, he stated that he regrets posing nude despite not showing any full frontal nudity.[24]\n\nUrban performed \"Lights on the Hill\" for Tamworth's 2004 tribute concert following the death of Australia's Slim Dusty, an artist whom he had both written for and covered.[25][26]\n\nIn 2005, Urban performed in front of European audiences for the first time. In May, Urban supported Bryan Adams on his UK and Ireland tour, which included dates at Earls Court, London, SECC, Glasgow, and The Point, Dublin. On 6 June a UK-only album, Days Go By, was released. The album contained songs from both Be Here and Golden Road.\n\n\"You Look Good in My Shirt\" was originally intended to be the fifth single from this album.[27] Instead, Capitol chose to release \"Days Go By\", the lead-off to his third American album Be Here. By late 2004, this song became Urban's fifth number one hit on the country chart. Although it was not officially released, \"You Look Good in My Shirt\" spent one week at number 60 on the country charts in July 2004[28] and remained a fan favourite.[27] The next single from this album was the #2 \"You're My Better Half\", followed by the five-week number 1 \"Making Memories of Us\", which was written by Rodney Crowell and previously recorded by both Tracy Byrd[29] and Crowell's side project The Notorious Cherry Bombs.[30] The next singles from this album were \"Better Life\" and \"Tonight I Wanna Cry\". The former, which Urban wrote with Richard Marx, spent six weeks at number 1 and the latter spent three weeks at number 2. After this song, \"Live to Love Another Day\" spent 14 weeks on the country chart, reaching a peak of number 48, although it was never officially released as a single.[28]\n\n2006\u20132008: Love, Pain, & The Whole Crazy Thing and Greatest Hits: 18 Kids [ edit ]\n\nUrban performs in 2007\n\nOn 21 August 2006, Urban's \"Once in a Lifetime\" debuted at No. 17, setting what was then a new record for the highest-debuting country single in the 62-year history of the Hot Country Songs chart.[31] Despite the high debut, the song peaked at number 6.[22] Following it was \"Stupid Boy\", which was co-written by Sarah Buxton, went to number 3, and won him his second Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 2007.[22] The album's next two singles, \"I Told You So\" and \"Everybody\", respectively peaked at numbers two and five.[22] Urban released his first greatest hits collection Greatest Hits: 18 Kids on 20 November 2007. This compilation contains all of his Top 10 hits, along with two new songs, \"Got It Right This Time (The Celebration) and a cover of Steve Forbert's \"Romeo's Tune\".\"\n\nIn January 2008, Urban embarked on the \"Love, Pain and the Whole Crazy Carnival Ride World Tour\" with fellow country singer Carrie Underwood. In early May 2008, Urban debuted a new song at the Grand Ole Opry titled \"A New Sunshine\". That same month, Urban recorded a new version of \"You Look Good in My Shirt\" and released it as a single in June of that year. \"Over the years it (\"You Look Good In My Shirt\") has always played like a hit song,\" Urban said. \"That, combined with numerous requests from both fans and radio about why it was never a single, inspired us to get back into the studio and re-record the song.\" The single was a precursor to the \"Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy World Tour\" concert DVD release in the fall of 2008. Later that year, Urban served as a duet artist for Brad Paisley's single \"Start a Band,\" on which both he and Paisley sang and played guitar. This song was included on Paisley's album Play and it went to No. 1 in January 2009.\n\n2008\u20132010: Defying Gravity [ edit ]\n\nUrban announced that the lead single for his fifth studio album would be titled \"Sweet Thing\".

The fourth single, \"'Til Summer Comes Around\", went to number three. The fifth and final single \"I'm In\" is a cover of a song by Radney Foster, taken from the same album as \"Raining on Sunday\" was. This song was also recorded by The Kinleys,[21] whose version had been a Top 40 single in 2000. Urban's rendition went to number two. Between the two, Urban also made a guest appearance on then-labelmate Emily West's single \"Blue Sky,\" which charted at number 38.\n\nUrban's 2009 Escape Together tour, supporting the Defying Gravity album, featured many big-name opening acts, such as Taylor Swift, Sugarland, and Jason Aldean.
