Even an open letter in the Huffington Post pleading that the tabloids stop reporting false stories about her and her marriage has not managed to take tabloid focus off the star.\n\nAlthough the pregnancy rumors have halted since Jen penned the letter in the publication, she remains the subject of falsities about her marriage and has recently admitted that she feels although the essay did make media members more aware of the affects such falsities have on celebrities and the manner that women are discussed in the media, that it did little to halt the fabricated tales from making the front page about she and other female figures in the spotlight.\n\nThe beauty spoke with Variety recently on the topic as Vanity Fair relays.\n\n\"I had no idea it would get the response that it did; I was thrilled with that. But sadly, people still buy into it. They are consumers of this trash and they eat it up. It's definitely in people's consciousness a lot more. But you're always going to have the Piers Morgans of the world contradicting something that comes from the heart and saying, 'You're a hypocrite.\"\n\n\"At one point, Justin was having a blast with Orlando and Leo [DiCaprio]. But Jen obviously didn't like that they were stealing his attention away from her, so she walked over and took Justin's hand and pulled him away.\"\n\nJennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux Not Caught Openly Fighting At Orlando Bloom's Birthday Party, Despite Report https://t.co/sup8sK42He \u2014 Gossip Cop (@GossipCop) January 26, 2017\n\n\u2014 Gossip Cop (@GossipCop) January 26, 2017\n\nJennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux join in on the fun at Orlando Bloom's surprise birthday party https://t.co/aVf3C4PqrO pic.twitter.com/YKEqP7bxZs \u2014 People Magazine (@people) January 16, 2017\n\n\u2014 People Magazine (@people) January 16, 2017\n\n\"If I am some kind of symbol to some people out there, then clearly I am an example of the lens through which we, as a society, view our mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, female friends and colleagues. The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing. The way I am portrayed by the media is simply a reflection of how we see and portray women in general, measured against some warped standard of beauty.\"", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/784fcf0a3514f31a582147119c01ff3d?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fed4959c-fb17-4183-9a69-aa4c161aa162.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/W4tCBPELsZJiig5WwEg6.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d7bb3a79-5556-4b77-95b6-1e7023672181.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/9e1eeba9-a8c9-4dbf-bf8e-15ed56ed5931.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/3923928/despite-claims-jennifer-aniston-and-justin-theroux-did-not-fight-at-orlando-blooms-birthday-celebration/", "title": "Despite Claims, Jennifer Aniston And Justin Theroux Did Not Fight At Orlando Bloom's Birthday Celebration", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Despite Claims, Jennifer Aniston And Justin Theroux Did Not Fight At Orlando Bloom's Birthday Celebration", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/3923928/despite-claims-jennifer-aniston-and-justin-theroux-did-not-fight-at-orlando-blooms-birthday-celebration/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Despite Claims, Jennifer Aniston And Justin Theroux Did Not Fight At Orlando Bloom's Birthday Celebration", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-01-26 18:49:59Z", "section": "Fact Checking"}, "description": "Despite Claims, Jennifer Aniston And Justin Theroux Did Not Fight At Orlando Bloom's Birthday Celebration", "keywords": "Fact Checking", "news_keywords": "Fact Checking", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1485456599.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
