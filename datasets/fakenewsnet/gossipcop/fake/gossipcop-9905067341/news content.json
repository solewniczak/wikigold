In the meantime, a Forbes fact check found that West\u2019s current net worth is actually closer to an estimated $1.8 billion, with the Bloomberg figure having been based on \u201ctheoretical future expectations\u201d regarding revenue West\u2019s deal with Gap will yield.\n\nSee: The Richest Celebrity From Every State\n\nFind: Who\u2019s Richer? Taylor Swift, Jennifer Aniston Or One Of These Other Big-Name Celebrities?\n\n\n\nThe rapper legally changed his name to Ye (pronounced yay) on Oct. 18. The petition, which was filed Aug. 24, does not appear to include a middle or last name.\n\nHe began using the name in 2018 as a Twitter handle, but it dates as far back as 2012, heard in the song \u2018Clique,\u2019 which featured Jay-Z and Big Sean. He noted in a 2020 interview with radio host Big Boy that ye is a word common to the Bible meaning \u201cyou.\u201d\n\nWhile Ye\u2019s net worth hasn\u2019t been updated since he released his latest album this past summer, it\u2019s clear that he has amassed an enormous fortune from a combination of business ventures after breaking into the music scene with his 2004 album \u201cThe College Dropout.\u201d However, you might be surprised just how small of a percentage his music contributes to his overall wealth as we dive into how the world-famous entrepreneur got his start.\n\nMake Your Money Work Better for You\n\nEarly Life and Rise to Music Stardom\n\nBorn Kanye Omari West on June 8, 1977 in Atlanta, Georgia, West lived with his parents, Ray and Donda West, for three years until their divorce. His mother then relocated them to Chicago, Illinois. The mother-son duo went on to live in China for one year while Kanye was 10, which he said had a huge impact on his life. Donda played a tremendous role as both his mother and manager, publishing the book \u201cRaising Kanye: Life Lessons from the Mother of a Hip-Hop Superstar\u201d just six months before her passing in November 2007 due to surgery complications.\n\nThe American rapper, producer, fashion designer and entrepreneur first began his music career in 2000 as a producer for Jay-Z\u2019s Roc-A-Fella Records, working with artists like Alicia Keys, John Legend and Janet Jackson. In 2002, West was in a severe car crash which left his jaw wired shut and inspired the track \u201cThrough the Wire,\u201d which featured on his 2004 debut album \u201cThe College Dropout.\u201d The album was titled appropriately, as West had dropped out of the Chicago\u2019s American Academy of Art to pursue music.\n\nMake Your Money Work Better for You\n\nMore: 30 Celebrities Who Went From Rags to Riches\n\nThe album received 10 Grammy nominations and a certified triple platinum in the U.S, taking West to the next level of his stardom. With his newfound fame, he continued to release albums: \u201cLate Registration\u201d in 2005, \u201cGraduation\u201d in 2007, \u201c808s & Heartbreak\u201d in 2008, \u201cMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\u201d in 2010, a collaboration album with Jay-Z titled \u201cWatch the Throne\u201d in 2011, \u201cYeezus\u201d in 2013, \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d in 2016, \u201cYe\u201d in 2018 and \u201cJesus is King\u201d in 2019.\n\nWest is no stranger to accolades, either. He boasts 21 Grammys and 70 Grammy nominations, as well as his albums \u201cYeezus\u201d and \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d both reaching the No.1 position on the Hot 200 Billboard chart.\n\nWest has continued to produce music for the likes of 6ix9ine, XXXTentacion, Lil Pump, Chance the Rapper, Kid Cudi, and Teyana Taylor. Even so, his musical endeavors account for a mere 0.05% of his wealth, or an estimated $90 million. The major stakes in his net worth remain largely in his fashion brand, Yeezy, which he owns 100% and earns $150-200 million in royalties per year.\n\nMake Your Money Work Better for You\n\nFashioning a Career\n\nMost of the 44-year-old\u2019s assets come from his fashion ventures, rather than music. His career in the fashion industry started from a sneaker collaboration project between Nike and himself \u2014 Air Yeezys \u2014 which launched in 2007. The cult following for West\u2019s designs quickly grew and eventually lead to a 10-year contract with Nike\u2019s rival company Adidas in 2013. Two years later, the Yeezy Boost 350 sneaker was born, which created an insane resale value. The coveted shoes skyrocketed in price online, which sneaker-heads lapped up like milk from a spoon.\n\nRelated: Kanye West\u2019s Old Yeezys Could Be the Most Expensive Shoes Ever Bought or Sold\n\nThe iconic sneakers placed Kanye in a world of his own. Yeezy is set to release several new sneakers by the end of this year; three Yeezy Boost 350s V2s called \u201cMono Ice,\u201d \u201cMono Mist\u201d and \u201cMono Clay,\u201d plus a rumored new 700 V3 color way which could be glow-in-the-dark. The news comes after his major restock on Yeezy Supply August 2nd.\n\nIn June 2020, West\u2019s Yeezy fashion brand signed a 10-year partnership with Gap. The co-branded collection called Yeezy X Gap will range for men, women and children and is expected to tremendously increase the value of the rapper\u2019s empire.\n\nDon\u2019t get too ahead of yourself, the former CEO of Gap, Mickey Drexler, warned West. Drexler believes West has some potential red flags in his deal, stating Kayne \u201cis not a corporate person.\u201d But the combined value of Yeezy \u2014 an Adidas partnership \u2014 and Yeezy X Gap already surpassed $4.7 billion, despite the Gap collaboration not even re-leasing yet.\n\nKim Kardashian Split\n\nWest and Kim Kardashian West announced their shocking split in February of this year, after several public meltdowns and Twitter rants from the artist, in which he compared his life to the Jordan Peele horror movie \u201cGet Out.\u201d The pair had long fought over where they should live and raise their family of four, with West choosing the sanctuary of his 4,524-acre Wyoming ranch and Kim preferring the sprawling hills of Los Angeles, near her large immediate family.\n\nThe separated couple will eventually have to divvy up their assets in the divorce proceedings, which include an impressive portfolio of real estate together, stakes in each other\u2019s companies and custody of their four children \u2014 North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm. Despite Kim selling out her stake in Yeezy earlier this year, Kanye still has a reported $64 million hold in Kim\u2019s lounge and shape-wear brand, Skims.\n\nRead: Kimye and 30 of the Most Expensive Celebrity Divorces To Rock Hollywood\n\nThe A-list divorce is set to be one of the most infamous separations to rock the world this year and will be tasked with tediously separating their combined wealth. Similarly, the world delved into another powerhouse couple divorce this year, the separation of Melinda and Bill Gates\u2019 $148 billion net worth.\n\nThe couple are said to be on good terms, with Kardashian supporting West at his latest endeavor, the listening party for his latest album titled \u201cDonda\u201d on July 22. The pair coordinated in monochromatic red outfits, with West adorning several unreleased pieces from his Yeezy X Gap line.\n\nDespite being supportive of one another through the divorce, sources state Kardashian is still planning an upcoming rebrand of her beauty line KKW BEAUTY to separate herself from West\u2019s last name.\n\nOther Business Ventures\n\nKanye has always lived by the motto \u201cDream Big,\u201d like when he tried to run for president in 2020. However, this has occasionally ended with some of his business ventures failing through the years, including his travel company Kanye Travel Ventures, fast-food chain venture with Fatburger and, most recently, his ties to the nonprofit Donda House.\n\nFind Out: 30 Celebrities Making Serious Dough in the Food Industry\n\nWest has long been philanthropic; in 2011 he and fellow rapper Che \u201cRhymefest\u201d Smith co-created the nonprofit charity Donda House in his hometown of Chicago to honor his late-mother. The charity become the center of a controversy in 2018 when Rhymefest tweeted at rapper Drake for support, stating Kanye abandoned the project.\n\nKim Kardashian West took to Twitter to blast Rhymefest, saying he would no longer be featured on Kanye\u2019s album at the time, \u201cYe.\u201d This backlash came after the nonprofit released a statement in May 2018 that the charity was unable to secure funding for construction and was distancing itself from Kanye West due to his public support of President Donald Trump. The nonprofit quickly rebranded after the incident to Art of Culture, Inc. and has separated its ties from Kanye all-together.\n\nDespite all this, West continues to aim high with his efforts. His latest big dream began in 2018, an initiative he announced as Yeezy Home, to create an affordable housing development in Calabasas, California. West fiddled with several \u201cStar Wars\u201d-inspired dome prototypes, which the city eventually made him tear down due to lack of permits.\n\nYeezy Home is the architecture arm of his expanded Yeezy empire and aims to tackle the housing crisis by creating low-income homes composed of prefabricated concrete modules, called YZY SHLTRS. It is unsure if West is continuing with this project, but true Kanye fans know to never get too comfortable, as the artist is always coming up with something new.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nLast updated: October 19, 2021", "images": ["https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/themes/rockefeller-lite/assets/src/images/best-banks-2021/spinner-solid.svg.gzip", "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/themes/rockefeller-lite/assets/src/images/home/fortune.png", "http://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/themes/rockefeller-lite/img/logo-zergnet.png", "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/themes/rockefeller-lite/assets/src/images/home/cbs.png", "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled-design-1.png?w=352&quality=75", "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image_6487327-2-150x150.jpg", "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_editorial_10704781a-1.jpg?w=675&quality=75", "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/themes/rockefeller-lite/assets/src/images/home/msn.png", "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/The-GBR-Closer-icon.png", "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/themes/rockefeller-lite/assets/src/images/home/cnn-money.png", "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/themes/rockefeller-lite/assets/src/images/best-banks-2021/times-light.svg.gzip", "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/themes/rockefeller-lite/assets/src/images/gbr-logo.svg.gzip", "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/themes/rockefeller-lite/assets/src/images/home/time-money.png", "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/themes/rockefeller-lite/assets/src/images/home/aol.png", "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/newsletter-cta-bg-desktop.png?w=653&quality=1", "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_editorial_10704781a-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shutterstock_editorial_10704781a-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Hoey", "About The Author", "Katherine Hoey Is A Freelance Journalist Currently Living In Miami.
