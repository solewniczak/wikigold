She actually wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Drake\u2019s got more than once secret love child out there. He\u2019s such a huge player and she knows he\u2019s a target for these girls trying to get that baby mama money. Nicki\u2019s not judging though, it\u2019s his business but she\u2019s damn sure relieved she\u2019s moved on and isn\u2019t still in the mix with him.\u201d\n\nNicki was in that mix with Drake for a while as the two seemed to have an up and down relationship for many years. He\u2019s also been romantically linked to many other singers such as Rihanna and even Jennifer Lopez. Most recently, Nicki\u2019s been romantically linked to Eminem after she jokingly answered \u201cyes\u201d when a fan asked her if she was dating the rapper. Romantic rumors asider, it\u2019s good to know Nicki is choosing not to judge Drake in the midst of his issues.\n\nDrake\u2019s current issues revolves around his feud with hip hop artist Pusha T. The two have been calling each other out on their own diss tracks and Pusha\u2019s most recent track \u201cStory of Adidon\u201d is what started speculation about Drake\u2019s secret love child. \u201cYou are hiding a child, let that boy come home, Deadbeat mothaf**ka playin\u2019 border patrol, ooh Adonis is your son, And he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that\u2019s real, Love that baby, respect that girl, Forget she\u2019s a pornstar, let her be your world,\u201d some of the lyrics to the track read. Drake has yet comment on the speculation.", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/erin_silvia1.jpg?w=48", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/emily-ratajkowski-cosrx-snail-mucin-essence.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=4630073&action=edit", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/taylor.jpg?w=300", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Kristin-Cavallari-Chase-Rice-ss-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/leonardo-dicaprio-gisele-bundchen-salma-hayek-ed-norton.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kim-Kardashian-41-Is-The-Ultimate-Beach-Babe-FTR-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nicki-minaj-why-she-thinks-drake-could-have-more-than-one-secret-love-child-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/massage-gun-adobe-stock-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ncte-con-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/thomas-struggle-spoilers-BB-HW.jpg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nicki-minaj-why-she-thinks-drake-could-have-more-than-one-secret-love-child-ftr.jpg"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nicki-minaj-why-she-thinks-drake-could-have-more-than-one-secret-love-child-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Silvia", "Louisa Ballhaus", "Katie Decker-Jacoby", "Jiji Ugboma", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason", "News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/30/nicki-minaj-drake-more-than-one-secret-child/", "title": "Nicki Minaj: Why She Thinks Drake Could Have More Than One Secret Love Child", "meta_data": {"description": "Nicki Minaj: Why she thinks Drake could have more than one love child", "news_keywords": "Drake, Nicki Minaj", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 5.9.2", "author": "Erin Silvia", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Hollywood Life", "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Nicki Minaj: Why She Thinks Drake Could Have More Than One Secret Love Child", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/30/nicki-minaj-drake-more-than-one-secret-child/", "description": "Nicki Minaj is not surprised about the rumors that Drake has a child from a previous fling with an adult film star due to his \u2018playboy\u2019 stereotype and in fact, she thinks there may be o\u2026", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nicki-minaj-why-she-thinks-drake-could-have-more-than-one-secret-love-child-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 350}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-31T02:06:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-31T02:06:52+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Nicki Minaj: Why She Thinks Drake Could Have More Than One Secret Love Child"}, "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nicki-minaj-why-she-thinks-drake-could-have-more-than-one-secret-love-child-ftr.jpg?w=620", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HollywoodLife", "title": "Nicki Minaj: Why She Thinks Drake Could Have More Than One Secret Love Child", "description": "Nicki Minaj: Why she thinks Drake could have more than one love child"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527631200.0, "source": "http://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
