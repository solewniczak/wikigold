Even after their split in September 2016, none of the stars have publicly spoken ill about the other one. Angelina Jolie's recent podcast conversation has made some to believe that the reason behind her split with husband Brad Pitt was her cancer scare. One publication, Philippine Daily Inquirer, even reported that Jolie supposedly said her health concerns led to her divorce with Pitt. Reportedly, the actor was afraid of her cancer and decided to end the marriage.\n\nIn a recent interview on the Hollywood Reporter's podcast for her film First They Killed My Father, Angelina Jolie candidly revealed that her health problems reportedly took a toll on her married life with Brad Pitt.\n\nBack in 2013, Angelina Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning from her doctors that she had an 87 percent risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Angelina's mother, Marcheline Bertrand, also had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer when she was just 56 years old. Her double mastectomy lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, and Angelina Jolie followed it up with a reconstructive surgery involving allografts and implants.\n\n\"I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity,\" she wrote in one of her op-eds for the New York Times.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/75bc5f8f-bdb6-4450-8b34-19f657ce2327.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/5a8d67e0-f95c-458e-a699-7044c2610778.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/2236d9db-e4d3-4354-b26e-38352fa5255d.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/cb72b1bf-36aa-44a8-a6c7-835711fcfff0.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/b61a3fab-062d-497a-9cba-8ea4f2d4a966.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2796d5da17c476cbb25029169dfc079c?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/0bb6f898-74de-4517-965d-61d4feb5ccf4.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4673859/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-divorce-jolies-cancer-reportedly-scared-brad-pitt-led-to-their-split/", "title": "Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Divorce -- Jolie's Cancer Scare Did Not Lead To Split [Debunked]", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Divorce -- Jolie's Cancer Scare Did Not Lead To Split [Debunked]", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4673859/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-divorce-jolies-cancer-reportedly-scared-brad-pitt-led-to-their-split/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Divorce -- Jolie's Cancer Scare Did Not Lead To Split [Debunked]", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-12-09 01:01:46Z", "section": "Fact Checking"}, "description": "Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Divorce -- Jolie's Cancer Scare Did Not Lead To Split [Debunked]", "keywords": "Fact Checking", "news_keywords": "Fact Checking", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512781306.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
