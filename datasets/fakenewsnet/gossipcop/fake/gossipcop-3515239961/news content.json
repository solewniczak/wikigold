You see what looks like a bump ... thing is ... we did some digging and it was apparently shot at a Golden Globes party they attended 11 months ago.\n\nKylie hadn't even started seeing her baby daddy-to-be, Travis Scott until April ... which is around the time we know she got pregnant.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/74/4by3/2022/03/15/74c480e1c4ee4575a85f36ee3f4f8450_md.jpg",
