The former King Of Diamonds stripper has hired celebrity attorney Lisa Bloom to file a restraining order against Kardashian.\n\nThe news came via a tweet from Bloom on Friday.\n\n\"I represent Blac Chyna. I just gave Rob Kardashian notice that we'll be in court Monday seeking restraining orders against him. More to come,\" she tweeted.\n\nThe day before Bloom gave her opinion on the Blac Chyna-Rob Kardashian situation via the social media platform.\n\n\"My take: what Rob Kardashian did to Blac Chyna could be 'revenge porn,' and illegal,\" she wrote. \"Women, stand up for our rights!\"\n\nAs the Inquisitr previously reported, on Wednesday, Rob Kardashian went on a rampage against the mother of his child on Instagram and Twitter. His social media posts blasted Chyna for allegedly cheating on him in his bed. He also shared nude pictures of her and revealed that he had paid for her weight loss surgery after her pregnancy. Rob's Instagram account was eventually suspended because of his posts, but then he continued his tirade on Twitter.\n\nIn response, Chyna posted a now deleted Snapchat where she accused Rob of abusing her physically.\n\nAs Gossip Cop reported, one of Chyna's other attorneys, Walter Mosley, made a statement on her behalf soon after Kardashian's tantrum cooled down.", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fed4959c-fb17-4183-9a69-aa4c161aa162.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/W4tCBPELsZJiig5WwEg6.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dee9f0b262b2cc498f0c56b5221d31a3?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/YkO9RX7cDoMm6hx5W74a.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d7bb3a79-5556-4b77-95b6-1e7023672181.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4352553/blac-chyna-hires-lisa-bloom-as-attorney-for-restraining-order-case-against-rob-kardashian/", "title": "Blac Chyna Hires Lisa Bloom As Attorney For Restraining Order Case Against Rob Kardashian", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Blac Chyna Hires Lisa Bloom As Attorney For Restraining Order Case Against Rob Kardashian", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4352553/blac-chyna-hires-lisa-bloom-as-attorney-for-restraining-order-case-against-rob-kardashian/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Blac Chyna Hires Lisa Bloom As Attorney For Restraining Order Case Against Rob Kardashian", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-07-07 17:03:23Z", "section": "Famous Relationships"}, "description": "Blac Chyna Hires Lisa Bloom As Attorney For Restraining Order Case Against Rob Kardashian", "keywords": "Famous Relationships", "news_keywords": "Famous Relationships", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499447003.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
