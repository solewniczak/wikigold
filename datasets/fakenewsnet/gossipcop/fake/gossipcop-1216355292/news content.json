I don\u2019t want to disrespect you, but I\u2019ve known for almost ten years. What\u2019s up?'\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe started laughing and she said, \u2018I\u2019m always going to be Meg. Meg.'\u201d\n\nMartin added, \u201cBut next time I see them I will be respectful and know my protocol. But Meg is always going to be Meg, that\u2019s how it is!\u201d\n\nWatch our full special, Meghan and Harry \u2013 a Fairy-Tale Wedding, on PeopleTV, now available on PeopleTV.com and on your favorite streaming device.\n\nMartin says there were just five people around while prepping Meghan for her walk down the aisle: the bride, himself, hair stylist Serge Normant, dress designer Clare Waight Keller and Meghan\u2019s mom Doria Ragland, who Martin said was \u201cin good spirits.\u201d The atmosphere was very relaxed, partly thanks to Meghan playing \u201c1950s, chilled music\u201d via Spotify.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t seem nervous. She was very cool, she was regular Meghan,\u201d the makeup artist shares. \u201cI think we were nervous, but we didn\u2019t want to make her nervous so it was very chilled. Of course, brides have nerves, but if we didn\u2019t put so much expectation on it, it wouldn\u2019t have made her nervous. It was very even, very easy.\u201d\n\nMartin added that the bride stayed off her phone as they caught up by talking about mutual friends.\n\nDespite all their beauty work, putting on the wedding dress really made the moment feel real.\n\n\u201cIt was all so easy. It didn\u2019t hit us that she was getting married until she got the dress on,\u201d Martin said.\n\nHe added, \u201cIt was so beautiful and so architectural, and when she put it on it was like a glove. It was so easy. The spectacle of the veil and the crown and it was, \u2018Oh my goodness, this is really happening.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Harry and Meghan\u2019s Love Story\n\nThat feeling intensified when they arrived at Windsor Castle.\n\n\u201cNothing really hit any of us until we got there and we saw the people and the magnitude of everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last thing we said to each other was, \u2018We\u2019ll see you on the other side.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPrince Harry Marries Ms. Meghan Markle - Windsor Castle Meghan Markle | Credit: Brian Lawless - WPA Pool/Getty\n\nGettyImages-960063932 Prince Harry and Meghan Markle | Credit: Mark R. Milan/GC Images\n\nMartin said he got emotional when they saw Meghan after the ceremony to do touch-ups for their official portraits.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I started crying,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt was the first time was able to be there in person. It was almost like she looked at me and said, \u2018What did you think? How\u2019d it go?\u2019 And I lost it.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fgettyimages-960076038.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F08%2Fmeghan-makeup.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fgettyimages-960063932.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=600&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F08%2Fmeghan-makeup.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=600&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F08%2Fmeghan-makeup.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit", "Simon Perry", "May"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-told-makeup-artist-pal-before-royal-wedding/", "title": "'I'm Always Going to Be Meg': The Sweet Thing Meghan Markle Told Makeup Artist Pal Before Wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Meghan Markle,News,Royal Wedding", "news_keywords": "Meghan Markle,News,Royal Wedding", "description": "Meghan Markle\u00a0may now be officially known as the Duchess of Sussex, but to her friends, she's still just \"Meg\"", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "'I'm Always Going to Be Meg': The Sweet Thing Meghan Markle Told Makeup Artist Pal Before Wedding", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-told-makeup-artist-pal-before-royal-wedding/", "description": "Meghan Markle\u00a0may now be officially known as the Duchess of Sussex, but to her friends, she's still just \"Meg\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=600&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F08%2Fmeghan-makeup.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-told-makeup-artist-pal-before-royal-wedding/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F08%2Fmeghan-makeup.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-told-makeup-artist-pal-before-royal-wedding/", "title": "'I'm Always Going to Be Meg': The Sweet Thing Meghan Markle Told Makeup Artist Pal Before Wedding", "description": "Meghan Markle\u00a0may now be officially known as the Duchess of Sussex, but to her friends, she's still just \"Meg\"", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=600&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F08%2Fmeghan-makeup.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-told-makeup-artist-pal-before-royal-wedding/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
