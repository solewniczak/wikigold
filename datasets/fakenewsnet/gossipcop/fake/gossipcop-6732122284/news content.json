It was an apocalyptic year: 2012, end of the Mayan calendar and of the Twilight film franchise. Breaking Dawn \u2014 Part 2 hit theaters on November 16. Two days before, the future president of the United States tweeted this:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/268416910595600384\n\nAnd four days before that, he tweeted this:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/266972430638137344\n\nTwo weeks before that, he tweeted this:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/260814133690249217\n\nAnd the day before that, he tweeted this:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/260482827458592768\n\nFour days before that, he tweeted this:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258966137302315009\n\nAnd this!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258937466155831297\n\nAnd the day before that, he tweeted this.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258640349872926720\n\nThanks to the magic of social media and his own obsession with press coverage, the American people have access to a rich archive of our president\u2019s unseemly fixations. Trump\u2019s brief obsession with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart ranks alongside his diatribe about his predecessor\u2019s gum-chewing habit as the strangest of these. What drove him to tweet seven times about the breakup of America\u2019s sweethearts? Why did he seem so desperate for Pattinson\u2019s friendship? And what did the subjects of his sweaty speculation think of all this?\n\nUntil now, like the great philosophical inquiries, all of these questions were virtually unanswerable. Today, those of us who care about these things got some long-awaited insight into one of them, at least. That\u2019s because a noble reporter at Entertainment Weekly had the good sense to ask Pattinson about it. Unfortunately, Pattinson\u2019s answer wasn\u2019t particularly revealing:\n\nDoes it seem somewhat surreal that the current president of the United States once wrote a bunch of tweets about you?\n\n[Laughs] I think there\u2019s so many different levels of it. Your identity exists on many different planes at the same time and they all can be quite different from each other. When he said that, it didn\u2019t really mean anything. But I guess now I\u2019m sort of thinking, like, \u201cWell, I guess that is related to me.\u201d But how does that fit in with all the other things going on in my life? And sometimes you think, \u201cCan I use this in my acting? Or should I be putting it away.\u201d It\u2019s kind of interesting, I guess. I don\u2019t know \u2014 this could be why people get annoyed with me.\n\nNow all we need to do is pick the brain of MEAT BALL\u2019S GHOST, the guy who used the RPatz/KStew tweets to predict Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GHOSTofMEATBALL/status/258641295487156224", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%201024'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/Emily-Ulmer-scaled.jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201080%20720'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=913237892731778&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://static.spin.com/files/2017/08/GettyImages-133055487-1502980987.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/SPIN-Site-Horizontal-Image-Template-DandoCover-160x160.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cccf025abc7cc5dfad334f07dea3e1a8?s=300&d=mm&r=g", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20768'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/Mothica-bts_MG_7924.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://static.spin.com/files/2021/09/SPIN-Newsletter-Header-08-768x768.png", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/02/bloom-SPIN_IMPACT-Vol5-1-scaled.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://static.spin.com/files/2017/08/GettyImages-133055487-1502980987-compressed.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/First-armadillo-1-160x160.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/DURAN_DURAN_420-copy.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/bloom-SPIN_IMPACT-Vol7-scaled.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20160%20160'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/bloom-SPIN_IMPACT-Vol6-scaled.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/998182.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/Boo-Radleys-Promo-July-202166351-160x160.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2021/09/spin-logo.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20696'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://static.spin.com/files/2021/09/Logo-SPIN.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202560%201707'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://static.spin.com/files/2017/08/GettyImages-133055487-1502980987-compressed.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andy Cush"], "canonical_link": "https://www.spin.com/2017/08/robert-pattinson-has-finally-responded-to-donald-trumps-bizarre-tweets-about-his-relationship-with-kristen-stewart/", "title": "Robert Pattinson Has Finally Responded to Donald Trump\u2019s Bizarre Tweets About His Relationship With Kristen Stewart", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Before he equivocated about a white supremacist murder, before he threatened war with North Korea, before he advocated a Muslim ban, before he drove a big", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Robert Pattinson Has Finally Responded to Donald Trump's Bizarre Tweets About His Relationship With Kristen Stewart", "description": "Before he equivocated about a white supremacist murder, before he threatened war with North Korea, before he advocated a Muslim ban, before he drove a big", "url": "https://www.spin.com/2017/08/robert-pattinson-has-finally-responded-to-donald-trumps-bizarre-tweets-about-his-relationship-with-kristen-stewart/", "site_name": "SPIN", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.spin.com/files/2017/08/GettyImages-133055487-1502980987-compressed.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 696}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/spin", "published_time": "2017-08-17T15:55:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@spin", "site": "@spin", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Andy Cush", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502985311.0, "source": "http://www.spin.com", "summary": ""}
