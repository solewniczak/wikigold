But the singer has denied it.\n\nPriyanka Chopra was attending Oscars 2017 with the Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what our desi girl and Baywatch star posted on Saturday while travelling to the Academy Awards, which confirmed that she is going to the prestigious event with Mick Jagger. But a recent tweet from the singer has hinted that he is not attending the night with the Bollywood star.\n\nPriyanka had shared a selfie with Mick Jagger, while enroute to Oscars and captioned the image as, \u201cChange of plans ! Oscars here we come.. @mickjagger LA LA land\u2026,\u201d and we believed her that she was attending the ceremony with the 74 year old singer. But Mick Jagger\u2019s latest tweet is just the opposite.\n\nWATCH | Oscars 2017: Indian Beauties Priyanka Chopra & Deepika Padukone Together At Pre-Oscars Party\n\nThe English singer refuted the reports by tweeting, \u201cHow odd, I read that I\u2019m going to the Oscars with Priyanka Chopra. I shall not be going to the Oscars at all.\u201d\n\nSee the picture shared by Priyanka Chopra:\n\nAnd, also see Mick Jagger\u2019s tweet:\n\nHow odd, I read that I\u2019m going to the Oscars with Priyanka Chopra. I shall not be going to the Oscars at all\u2026 \u2014 Mick Jagger (@MickJagger) February 25, 2017\n\nWhile we kept wondering why Priyanka was attending the Oscars with the Rock legend, Mick\u2019s latest tweet is hinting that the image shared by PeeCee might just be from an airport encounter the Baywatch star had with Mike.\n\nWATCH VIDEO | List Of Top 5 Indians Who Won An Oscar\n\nAlso read | Priyanka Chopra confirms she is going to Oscars 2017 with Mick Jagger\n\nWell, Priyanka\u2019s Oscars 2017 plans are still not clear with us. This will be the second year that Priyanka would be seen at the biggest night of Hollywood.\n\nAlso read | Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra are slaying at the pre-Oscars 2017 parties. See pics\n\nLast year, she not only attended the ceremony, but even presented an award with actor Liev Schreiber.\n\nAt Oscars 2016, Priyanka was seen in a nude white gown and was quite a hit at the after party too. But the 89th Academy Awards this year are more important for her as she is set to make her Hollywood debut with Baywatch opposite stars Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron.", "images":
