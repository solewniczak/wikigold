Amidst rumors that the actress is marrying a British businessman, she\u2019s put permanent roots down in California by purchasing the massive Cecil B. DeMille estate \u2014 check out pics of the lavish mansion here.\n\nAngelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles\u2026and it\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s historic mansion, and now, she\u2019s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.\n\nCecil\u2019s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There\u2019s tons of space for the six kids, too \u2014 the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.\n\nThis huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.\n\nThe actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she\u2019s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie\u2019s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she\u2019s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane \u2014 check it out in the gallery above.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think of Angelina\u2019s new house? Do you think she\u2019s prepping for a wedding?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alyssa_norwin.jpg?w=48", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/taylor.jpg?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bella-Hadid-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=4630073&action=edit", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-practice-presentation.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brigitte-nielson-wraps-arm-around-husband-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AP21265583383493_1440x1080.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/angelina-jolie-new-mansion-ftr.jpg?w=600", "https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nicole-leans-rafe-days-of-our-lives-jj.jpg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/angelina-jolie-new-mansion-ftr.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/evan-rachel-wood-and-marilyn-manson-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/massage-gun-adobe-stock-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/angelina-jolie-new-mansion-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Norwin", "Thea Glassman", "Jason Pham", "Nikki Brown", "Amy Mistretta", "Richard Simms", "Deputy Editor Of New York City"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/04/14/angelina-jolie-new-house-mansion-cecil-b-demille-pics/", "title": "Angelina Jolie Buys $25 Million L.A.
