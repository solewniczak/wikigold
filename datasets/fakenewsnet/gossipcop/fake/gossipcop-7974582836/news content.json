Magazine, as reported by Gossip Cop. The tabloid also alleges that Mariah and Bryan made a deal over what his stipend would be.\n\n\"It's crazy, but keeping up the public perception that she's desirable is more important to her than money.\"\n\nOK! Magazine also claimed that friends are worried that Mariah might be wasting her fortune on Tanaka.\n\nBut Gossip Cop says that they reached out to Mariah's rep, who said that the rumors published by OK! are fake news. Furthermore, as Gossip Cop notes, Carey is worth millions of dollars. If the rumors were true, a stipend for her dancer boyfriend is probably not going to hurt her much financially. If Tanaka is receiving monetary compensation from Carey, then it's in his capacity as her backup dancer and for appearing on her realty show, Mariah's World.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/b5c635af-0182-490b-9ed0-70d493ce0bd7.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/75bc5f8f-bdb6-4450-8b34-19f657ce2327.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6d24737c-2349-49d8-a143-a2972008e154.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/5a8d67e0-f95c-458e-a699-7044c2610778.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dee9f0b262b2cc498f0c56b5221d31a3?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/2236d9db-e4d3-4354-b26e-38352fa5255d.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4301436/did-mariah-carey-pay-bryan-tanaka-to-get-back-together-with-her/", "title": "Did Mariah Carey Pay Bryan Tanaka To Get Back Together With Her?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Did Mariah Carey Pay Bryan Tanaka To Get Back Together With Her?", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4301436/did-mariah-carey-pay-bryan-tanaka-to-get-back-together-with-her/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Did Mariah Carey Pay Bryan Tanaka To Get Back Together With Her?", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-06-17 21:18:27Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "Did Mariah Carey Pay Bryan Tanaka To Get Back Together With Her?", "keywords": "Rumors", "news_keywords": "Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497734307.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
