Whether those rumors have included Brad Pitt or other men, they don't seem to be true. The latest rumors surrounding Aniston were that she was dating Jake Gyllenhaal and that Reese Witherspoon had set the two up.\n\nThat report came from Woman's Day, but it has since been debunked by Gossip Cop. There is a good reason for the debunking of the latest rumor surrounding Aniston, and Gossip Cop was happy to release it.\n\n\"There was one major problem with the tabloid's article. Gyllenhaal was in Los Angeles shooting his upcoming movie Velvet Buzzsaw at the time the date was said to have taken place. The actor's own spokesperson confirmed to Gossip Cop that he wasn't in New York in late April and never met Aniston for dinner.\"\n\nGossip Cop has debunked a couple of Aniston rumors this week. There was another report from Life & Style claiming that Theroux and Aniston's close friend, Selena Gomez, were becoming more than friends. That report has since been debunked as well by the entertainment policing website.\n\nShe has also heard her name brought up in rumors about her being pregnant. Those rumors are false as well.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/75bc5f8f-bdb6-4450-8b34-19f657ce2327.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/2236d9db-e4d3-4354-b26e-38352fa5255d.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/5a8d67e0-f95c-458e-a699-7044c2610778.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/cb72b1bf-36aa-44a8-a6c7-835711fcfff0.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/b61a3fab-062d-497a-9cba-8ea4f2d4a966.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c4ef2327345d36a953414934ea55324?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/0bb6f898-74de-4517-965d-61d4feb5ccf4.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jennifer-aniston-is-not-dating-jake-gyllenhaal.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jennifer-aniston-is-not-dating-jake-gyllenhaal.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4904075/jennifer-aniston-isnt-dating-jake-gyllenhaal-despite-report-that-reese-witherspoon-set-them-up-debunked/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Isn't Dating Jake Gyllenhaal, Despite Report That Reese Witherspoon Set Them Up [Debunked]", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Isn't Dating Jake Gyllenhaal, Despite Report That Reese Witherspoon Set Them Up [Debunked]", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4904075/jennifer-aniston-isnt-dating-jake-gyllenhaal-despite-report-that-reese-witherspoon-set-them-up-debunked/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Jennifer Aniston Isn't Dating Jake Gyllenhaal, Despite Report That Reese Witherspoon Set Them Up [Debunked]", "image": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jennifer-aniston-is-not-dating-jake-gyllenhaal.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-05-17 19:20:30Z", "section": "Fact Checking"}, "description": "Jennifer Aniston Isn't Dating Jake Gyllenhaal, Despite Report That Reese Witherspoon Set Them Up [Debunked]", "keywords": "Fact Checking", "news_keywords": "Fact Checking", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526584830.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
