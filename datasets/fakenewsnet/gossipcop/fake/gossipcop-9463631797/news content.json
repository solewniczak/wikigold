That's according to an article in Radar Online where an alleged insider source claims that Jane wants Brad to get back with Jennifer now that her relationship with Justin Theroux is over.\n\n\"Jane and the whole Missouri-based Pitt family haven't been disrespectful about Jen and Justin's marriage, but once it became apparent things wouldn't work out they actively pushed Brad to get back in touch,\" the source said to Radar. \"Now they're determined to see them back together for a second chance.\"\n\nBut celebrity rumor watchdog, Gossip Cop, is saying that the story is false based on their research. They confirmed that the two exes communicate sometimes via text but they haven't seen each other in a long time. There was also no contact between them during the week since Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their divorce.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Radar Online has made allegations that Jane Pitt has tried to influence her son's dating decisions. They have previously reported that she called Aniston to help Brad \"get back on his feet.\" According to Gossip Cop, Radar Online's sister publication has also made up stories about Brad Pitt's mom. They recently claimed that Jane Pitt moved into his home after his divorce from Angelina Jolie. Gossip Cop debunked each of these stories.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d7bb3a79-5556-4b77-95b6-1e7023672181.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/YkO9RX7cDoMm6hx5W74a.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/W4tCBPELsZJiig5WwEg6.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fed4959c-fb17-4183-9a69-aa4c161aa162.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dee9f0b262b2cc498f0c56b5221d31a3?s=800"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4801042/brad-pitts-mom-is-not-begging-him-to-get-back-with-jennifer-aniston-gossip-cop-reports/", "title": "Brad Pitt's Mom Is Not Begging Him To Get Back With Jennifer Aniston, 'Gossip Cop' Reports", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Brad Pitt's Mom Is Not Begging Him To Get Back With Jennifer Aniston, 'Gossip Cop' Reports", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4801042/brad-pitts-mom-is-not-begging-him-to-get-back-with-jennifer-aniston-gossip-cop-reports/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Brad Pitt's Mom Is Not Begging Him To Get Back With Jennifer Aniston, 'Gossip Cop' Reports", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-02-27 08:18:33Z", "section": "Fact Checking"}, "description": "Brad Pitt's Mom Is Not Begging Him To Get Back With Jennifer Aniston, 'Gossip Cop' Reports", "keywords": "Fact Checking", "news_keywords": "Fact Checking", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519719513.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
