You can argue that he\u2019s too pretty or too muscular or too talented, but I don\u2019t really see the flaws in those complaints. So, let\u2019s just all agree that Efron is gorgeous, and if he asked you to help him cover up a murder\u2026okay, okay, obviously that isn\u2019t the best argument. But, the first look at Zac Efron as a serial killer is here, and even though his character was obviously an awful man, Efron still manages to look totally charming. Which, considering the fact that he\u2019s playing Ted Bundy, makes perfect sense.\n\nEfron is set to star as Bundy in the film, Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, alongside Lily Collins who will play Bundy\u2019s girlfriend, Elizabeth Kloepfer. The biopic is already so highly anticipated that fans have been commenting and talking about Efron\u2019s role as Bundy, even though they just started filming this week.\n\nNow, in case you aren\u2019t aware of who Ted Bundy was (and count yourself lucky if you don\u2019t), then you might want to sit down. Not only was he a serial killer, Bundy was also a rapist and necrophile who admitted to killing 36 women. So if you\u2019re used to watching Efron on screen playing another hunk, then this new movie will definitely change your perspective.\n\nEfron simply captioned the photo of him as Bundy taking a mug shot as \u201cMeet Ted,\u201d in matching Twitter and Instagram posts on Wednesday, but the excitement of seeing him dress up as such a notorious killer is already growing. Oh, and basically everyone was making the exact same joke.\n\nSeriously, Efron with Collins in a true crime movie? Basically, every Dateline watcher\u2019s dream come true, am I right? The story of Ted Bundy is certainly a gruesome one. Bundy raped and killed women, and also managed to evade arrest and conviction for years. He was known to be charming, and even found a wife in the midst of his killings.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F20%2Fsex-anxiety-tout.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F02%2F09%2FSwimsuits.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=822&h=411&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F01%2F18%2Fzac1-e1516296343809.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F17%2Fboob-sweat.jpg", "http://hellogiggles.com/img/misc/300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Fyuliya-kosolapova-bqirdOGHvYQ-unsplash-e1573767747444.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F07%2F08%2Fchiron-retrograde-2021.jpg", "http://hellogiggles.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F06%2F08%2Ffriendquestions-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fdream_about_ex.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=822&h=411&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F01%2F18%2Fzac1-e1516296343809.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Korey Lane", "Updated Jan"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/zac-efron-serial-killer-ted-bundy/", "title": "Heres your first terrifying look at Zac Efron as a serial killer Ted Bundy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Here's hoping you *won't* be oddly attracted to Zac Efron's latest movie character, notorious serial killer Ted Bundy.
