After seeing how close her sons have become with Blake Shelton, Gwen allegedly wants to adopt a little girl to make their family complete! \u2018The Voice\u2019 judge has a deadline in mind, too, according to a new report!\n\nGwen Stefani, 47, has the perfect life, and she wants to share it with someone special: a daughter! The \u201cMake Me Like You\u201d singer has always daydreamed about having a little girl of her own, according to a report from InTouch Weekly, and now she allegedly wants to make her wishes a reality! Gwen reportedly has plans in place to adopt a little girl, and is confident that partner Blake Shelton, 40, would be on board with the life-changing plan. She reportedly has the whole adoption process planned out!\n\n\u201cGwen is considering not just an infant, but children under the age of 5,\u201d a source told InTouch Weekly. \u201cShe wants to have a little girl before Christmas. Gwen is telling friends that she wants to keep this really private and that she is trying to not get too excited yet, but she has been daydreaming about names already. Her wish is to have a healthy, beautiful little girl she can dress up and play dolls with and do all the things she hasn\u2019t experienced as a mom to her sons.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s so lovely! Obviously, Gwen loves her three sons \u2014 Zuma, 8, Apollo, 3, and Kingston, 10 \u2014 to pieces, but she\u2019s never been able to experience being mother to a daughter. Gwen often plays with her sweet niece, Stella, who\u2019s besties with her cousins, and there\u2019s no doubt the cutie has inspired her! Plus, Gwen is basically the queen of kids fashion; her Harujuku Mini, Harujuku Lovers, and Chasing Fireflies lines for girls are all completely adorable.\n\nShe\u2019s more than ready for this big step, but there\u2019s just a little problem right now: she apparently hasn\u2019t told Blake that she allegedly wants to adopt a child. That\u2019s definitely something she should tell him! Like all her careful planning, Gwen\u2019s reportedly found the perfect way to fill him in, according to the source:\n\n\u201c[Gwen] is going to have a private romantic dinner with jut the two of them, with candles and flowers, and she is going to present the entire adoption scenario to [Blake]. She is really nervous. But Gwen knows how badly Blake wants a child, so she is hoping he will be excited about adopting a child with her,\u201d the source said.\n\nHollywoodLife.com has reached out for comment.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Gwen and Blake should adopt a baby girl?
