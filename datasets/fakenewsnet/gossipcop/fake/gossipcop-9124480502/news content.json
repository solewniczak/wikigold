The six children (Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Vivienne, Knox, and Shiloh Jolie-Pitt) are residing with Jolie while reportedly enjoying private visits with Pitt. However, according to Radar Online, a recent visit to Paris for Angelina and the children offered a shocking insight into Brad's relationship with the kids, particularly his look-alike first biological child, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt.\n\n\"Shiloh [left Brad Pitt's] name off [a message on the] Paris Bridge Of Love.\"\n\nPitt's first biological child then fastened the lock onto a bridge that overlooks the River Seine. Shiloh reportedly took the key for that lock and tossed it into the water.\n\nRadar Online pointed out that the photos obtained by the publication seemed \"innocent\" at first. Later, however, after seeing that Brad's initials were allegedly missing from the lock, the media outlet questioned Pitt's relationship with his kids.\n\n\"Shocking new photos exclusively obtained by Radar Online of [Brad Pitt's] estranged wife, Angelina Jolie, vacationing with their six kids in Paris appeared innocent but later proved to be every father's worst nightmare!\"\n\n\"It's as if Shiloh was disowning her dad!\"\n\nAnother mental health expert, Dr. Gilda Carle, told the media outlet that Jolie and Pitt should find a way to \"reinforce\" to their kids that although their parents are no longer together, the children will \"always\" have him in their lives as their father.\n\nHowever, Vogue pointed out that Angelina and Brad's split has been challenging for Jolie as well as her six kids and their dad. Admitting that she has gone through her \"ups and downs,\" Angelina revealed that she has prioritized her children.\n\n\"We all have our difficult times, but as a mother you also have a responsibility first and foremost towards the kids.\"\n\n\"We've all been a bit in lock-down,\" admitted Angelina. \"I think they're itching to get out in the world again.\"", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fed4959c-fb17-4183-9a69-aa4c161aa162.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/W4tCBPELsZJiig5WwEg6.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/YkO9RX7cDoMm6hx5W74a.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d7bb3a79-5556-4b77-95b6-1e7023672181.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fa8aa86244d76bf2aee7e2fb5b934ea3?s=800"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4777312/brad-pitt-reportedly-locked-out-by-shiloh-jolie-pitt-after-angelina-jolie-split-says-radar/", "title": "Brad Pitt Reportedly 'Locked Out' By Shiloh Jolie-Pitt After Angelina Jolie Split, Says 'Radar Online'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Brad Pitt Reportedly 'Locked Out' By Shiloh Jolie-Pitt After Angelina Jolie Split, Says 'Radar Online'", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4777312/brad-pitt-reportedly-locked-out-by-shiloh-jolie-pitt-after-angelina-jolie-split-says-radar/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Brad Pitt Reportedly 'Locked Out' By Shiloh Jolie-Pitt After Angelina Jolie Split, Says 'Radar Online'", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-02-08 17:46:14Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "Brad Pitt Reportedly 'Locked Out' By Shiloh Jolie-Pitt After Angelina Jolie Split, Says 'Radar Online'", "keywords": "Rumors", "news_keywords": "Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518111974.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
