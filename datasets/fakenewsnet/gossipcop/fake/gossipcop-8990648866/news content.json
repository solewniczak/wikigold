However, things have drastically changed for the sisters over the years.\n\nAccording to a report by Gossip Cop, rumors have been flying that Kendall and Kylie Jenner are no longer as close as they used to be since Kylie became a mother to her baby girl, Stormi Webster. Sources reportedly claim that since Kylie became a mother, she and Kendall really have nothing in common.\n\nMeanwhile, Kendall Jenner is busy \"jet-setting around the world and having fun on the dating scene\" as she builds up her modeling career. All the while Kylie is said to be \"wrapped up\" in being Stormi's mother, as well as focusing her cosmetic company. The alleged sources went on to claim that Kendall and Kylie can be very competitive with each other, which also causes problems.\n\nHowever, the outlet claims that all of the rumors about Kendall and Kylie Jenner's relationship are not true, citing that Kendall would have become more distant with sister Khloe Kardashian, who also welcomed a baby this year. However, Khloe and Kendall are very close, and have been spotted hanging out together multiple times since Khloe's return to L.A. in June.\n\nAs previously reported by the Inquisitr. Kendall and Kylie Jenner recently spent the day together, and even had a sisters photo shoot. The girls took multiple photos together posing for the cameras at different angles.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/b5c635af-0182-490b-9ed0-70d493ce0bd7.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a1aab41ece6a274bcaecb11bc798ff5?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6d24737c-2349-49d8-a143-a2972008e154.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/2236d9db-e4d3-4354-b26e-38352fa5255d.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/5a8d67e0-f95c-458e-a699-7044c2610778.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/75bc5f8f-bdb6-4450-8b34-19f657ce2327.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4996619/kendall-kylie-jenner-still-close-after-stormis-birth-despite-rumors/", "title": "Kendall And Kylie Jenner Still Close After Stormi's Birth, Despite Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kendall And Kylie Jenner Still Close After Stormi's Birth, Despite Rumors", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4996619/kendall-kylie-jenner-still-close-after-stormis-birth-despite-rumors/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Kendall And Kylie Jenner Still Close After Stormi's Birth, Despite Rumors", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-07-21 18:42:13Z", "section": "Celebrities"}, "description": "Kendall And Kylie Jenner Still Close After Stormi's Birth, Despite Rumors", "keywords": "Celebrities", "news_keywords": "Celebrities", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532198533.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
