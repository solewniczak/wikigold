Fans were stunned to hear the news that the pair had decided to end their nine-year marriage and couldn't help but wonder what caused the sad breakup.\n\nAccording to an April 3 report by Radar Online, there were many factors that led to the end of Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan's marriage. The first is likely the fact that Tatum wanted to have more children. The actor and his estranged wife are the parents of one daughter, Everly, but it seems that the Magic Mike star wanted a bigger family, which is something that Dewan didn't seem to be on board with. A past report by OK! Magazine claims that Jenna wanted to get back into acting and that caring for a newborn would derail those plans.\n\nThe baby battle allegedly continued for Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan when the actress got tired of being a housewife while her husband spent his time on movie sets. A source revealed that Tatum made more than enough money to support the family and that he wanted Dewan at home with little Everly so she would not be raised by nannies.\n\nThe jealousy allegedly began to rise in Jenna Dewan as Channing Tatum hit new levels of success with movies like 21 Jump Street, Magic Mike, and their sequels. The pair met on the set of the film Step Up as equals in their careers, but Channing's celebrity surpassed Jenna's over the years. However, that wasn't all Jenna was reportedly jealous of.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d7bb3a79-5556-4b77-95b6-1e7023672181.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/W4tCBPELsZJiig5WwEg6.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/YkO9RX7cDoMm6hx5W74a.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Channing-Tatum-and-Jenna-Dewan-split.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/9e1eeba9-a8c9-4dbf-bf8e-15ed56ed5931.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a1aab41ece6a274bcaecb11bc798ff5?s=800"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Channing-Tatum-and-Jenna-Dewan-split.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4852661/channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-jealousy-bitter-fights-led-to-split-reports-radar-online/", "title": "Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan: Jealousy & 'Bitter' Fights Led To Split, Reports 'Radar Online'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan: Jealousy & 'Bitter' Fights Led To Split, Reports 'Radar Online'", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4852661/channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-jealousy-bitter-fights-led-to-split-reports-radar-online/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan: Jealousy & 'Bitter' Fights Led To Split, Reports 'Radar Online'", "image": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Channing-Tatum-and-Jenna-Dewan-split.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-04-03 11:53:59Z", "section": "Famous Relationships"}, "description": "Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan: Jealousy & 'Bitter' Fights Led To Split, Reports 'Radar Online'", "keywords": "Famous Relationships", "news_keywords": "Famous Relationships", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522756439.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
