The country star poked fun at the seemingly never-ending speculation that Gwen may be pregnant with the couple's child (or children) during a recent performance in Oklahoma, where he joked that his girlfriend of over two years had just given birth to twins.\n\nShelton made the joke about his girlfriend \u2013 who has three children with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale \u2013 while introducing her on stage to perform with him during a recent concert in his home state last week.\n\nA video captured by concert goers, and obtained by PopCulture.com this week, shows the two teaming up to perform their 2016 duet \"Go Ahead And Break My Heart\" as they both stopped by Shelton's restaurant and events space Ole Red in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, last week.\n\nAfter Blake took the stage to perform a few of his hits, the crowd could then be heard chanting \"Gwen! Gwen! Gwen!\" as they encouraged the No Doubt singer to join her man on stage.\n\nThat's when Blake invited Stefani to join him as he performed for fans, introducing her by joking to the crowd that they were all \"lucky\" to have her perform because she'd only just given birth to their twins the day before.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/75bc5f8f-bdb6-4450-8b34-19f657ce2327.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/5a8d67e0-f95c-458e-a699-7044c2610778.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/2236d9db-e4d3-4354-b26e-38352fa5255d.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/cb72b1bf-36aa-44a8-a6c7-835711fcfff0.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/b61a3fab-062d-497a-9cba-8ea4f2d4a966.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/0bb6f898-74de-4517-965d-61d4feb5ccf4.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/04740ca59ff3a7ed6178872d42206b16?s=800"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4790273/blake-shelton-jokes-gwen-stefani-gave-birth-to-twins-yesterday-video/", "title": "Blake Shelton Jokes Gwen Stefani 'Gave Birth To Twins Yesterday' [Video]", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Blake Shelton Jokes Gwen Stefani 'Gave Birth To Twins Yesterday' [Video]", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4790273/blake-shelton-jokes-gwen-stefani-gave-birth-to-twins-yesterday-video/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Blake Shelton Jokes Gwen Stefani 'Gave Birth To Twins Yesterday' [Video]", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-02-17 05:53:32Z", "section": "Famous Relationships"}, "description": "Blake Shelton Jokes Gwen Stefani 'Gave Birth To Twins Yesterday' [Video]", "keywords": "Famous Relationships", "news_keywords": "Famous Relationships", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518846812.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
