Josh Duhamel finally responds to those Jennifer Garner dating rumors and he can\u2019t stop smiling!\n\nJosh Duhamel, 45, and Jennifer Garner, 45, are the same age, they\u2019re both in the business and they\u2019re both single. So, when rumors began to swirl that the two Hollywood A-listers were dating, fans went wild. However, you can pump the breaks on that one, because, although Duhamel thinks his Love, Simon co-star is \u201cincredible,\u201d he\u2019s laughing off those pesky dating rumors. \u201cIt does truly amaze me what some of the things that are printed,\u201d Duhamel told E! News at the premiere of the movie in Los Angeles on March 13. \u201cIt\u2019s like, how is that even legal? I try not to comment on it. It is what it is and it\u2019s part of the business. We\u2019re in the circus and that\u2019s part of being in the circus.\u201d\n\nWhile Duhamel is not dating Garner, their friendship is thriving \u2014 Hence their chemistry on-screen. \u201cHer kids weren\u2019t on set, neither were mine. We were only there for I think, a week and a half, two weeks, working, but I went to Jen a couple times asking advice on certain things and she\u2019s an incredible woman, she really is,\u201d Duhamel revealed. \u201cShe\u2019s very, very smart. She\u2019s a lot funnier than I think people realize.\u201d\n\nThe two star in the new drama, Love, Simon, where they play the parents of a gay teenage son named Simon, played by Nick Robinson. Simon has kept his sexuality secret, even from his family. Meanwhile, he has fallen in love with a fellow, anonymous closeted classmate after exchanging emails with them. Then a blackmailer finds the emails and threatens to out Simon.\n\nAlthough Duhamel may not be romancing Garner, another report claims he is smitten with another actress. He\u2019s reportedly dating Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, 28, , according to Us Weekly, which claims the two met at Jennifer Lopez\u2018s pre-Super Bowl concert. Gonz\u00e1lez has been romantically linked Liam Hemsworth, 28, and Calvin Harris, 34.\n\nFergie and Josh announced their split on September 14, 2017 after eight years of marriage and 13 years together. \u201cWith absolute love and respect we decided to separate as a couple earlier this year,\u201d the two said in a joint statement relayed by Fergie\u2019s rep. \u201cTo give our family the best opportunity to adjust, we wanted to keep this a private matter before sharing it with the public. We are and will always be united in our support of each other and our family.\u201d Despite their untimely ending, both Fergie and Josh remain good friends and continue to successfully co-parent their 4-year-old son Axl Jack.\n\nMeanwhile, Jennifer and her now ex-husband, Ben Affleck, 44, separated in 2015 after 10 years of marriage. They share three children together \u2014 Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5, who they too, like Fergie and Josh, continue co-parent their kids as good friends. Ben and Jen officially filed for divorce in April 2017, with Jen reportedly making the first move.", "images": ["https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Nate-Elena-spoilers-YR-HW.jpg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jennifer-Lopez-Dolce-Gabbana-Ad-ss-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/trav.jpg?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=4630073&action=edit", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/summer-fridays-deux-cookie-dough.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kim-Kardashian-41-Is-The-Ultimate-Beach-Babe-FTR-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/josh-duhamel-gushes-over-jennifer-garner-ftr.jpg", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/st-pattys-day-crafts.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=48", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ncte-con-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/josh-duhamel-gushes-over-jennifer-garner-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/massage-gun-adobe-stock-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/josh-duhamel-gushes-over-jennifer-garner-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Jana Randall", "Kristine Cannon", "Elizabeth Denton", "Jiji Ugboma", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/15/josh-duhamel-responds-jennifer-garner-dating-rumors-relationship-divorce-interview/", "title": "Josh Duhamel Gushes Over Jennifer Garner After Dating Rumors: \u2018She\u2019s An Incredible Woman\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Josh Duhamel responds to rumors that he's dating Jennifer Garner!", "news_keywords": "Jennifer Garner, Josh Duhamel", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 5.9.2", "author": "Jenna Lemoncelli", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Hollywood Life", "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/15/josh-duhamel-responds-jennifer-garner-dating-rumors-relationship-divorce-interview/?ia_markup=1"}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Josh Duhamel Gushes Over Jennifer Garner After Dating Rumors: \u2018She\u2019s An Incredible Woman\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/15/josh-duhamel-responds-jennifer-garner-dating-rumors-relationship-divorce-interview/", "description": "Are they or aren\u2019t they?!
