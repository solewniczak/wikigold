In a 2016 episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kylie asks Caitlyn, \"What do you feel like is a good age to have kids?\"\n\nAnswering her own question, Kylie says 25 while Caitlyn says 30.\n\n\"I feel like 30 is too late,\" the youngest Jenner sister touts. \"Every psychic said I'm only gonna have two kids.\"\n\nIn a 2015 interview with Teen Vogue, when Kylie was just 17, she also shared that she wanted to be a young mom, noting that she hoped to have children before she was 27.\n\n\"When I look to the far future and decide to have kids, I need to have a million girls,\" Kylie told the magazine. \"Ten years from now -- in 2025 -- I hope I have a kid.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nTravis Scott Plays Coy About Relationship With Kylie Jenner\n\nKylie Jenner Sent Kim Kardashian the
