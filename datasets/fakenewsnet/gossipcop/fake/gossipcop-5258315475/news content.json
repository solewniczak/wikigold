An insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY what went down.\n\n\u201cFergie and the [Black Eyed Peas] have parted ways,\u201d an insider close to Peas member will.i.am told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY today, May 29, after rumors started swirling that the songstress had been booted from the hip-hop/pop group. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t \u2018kicked out.\u2019 It was more a case of they had run their course together and were experiencing creative differences.\u201d\n\nOkay, that is definitely WAY less intense than what Media Take Out was reporting earlier, saying that Fergie\u2019s bandmate Taboo Nawasha, 41, dissed the 41-year-old singer with a scathing tweet on May 24 that said she wasn\u2019t one of the \u201cclassic\u201d BEP members, and implied she was totally out of the band. He then unfollowed the 41-year-old singer on Twitter today, the same day it was announced she had left Interscope Records to start her own record label under BMG and will be working with them on her upcoming solo album, Double Duchess.

It was actually Fergie\u2019s decision to leave, and the guys weren\u2019t too happy about it initially, but they\u2019re cool now and just looking forward to the future.\u201d\n\nAnother insider close to the group told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that the group started to think about breaking up around the Super Bowl in January, when Fergie performed solo during the ESPN party in Houston, Texas. If the group \u2014 which also includes member apl.de.ap \u2014 is officially donezo, we do hope they stay on good terms.
