Shepard was revered in the Hollywood and theater communities for his acting and writing. He was nominated for an acting Oscar for The Right Stuff, andhis play Buried Child won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1979.\n\nActor Ethan Hawke, who co-starred with Shepard in Snow Falling on Cedars (1999) and Hamlet (2000), remembered the deceased in a statement: \u201cHe was a poet of the first order. I\u2019ve acted in many of his plays and directed \u201cA Lie of the Mind.\u201d He played my father twice on film. Some days he could be irascible. At other times he could be profoundly wise and kind. He was the writer any serious American actor of my generation cut their teeth on. It is a gross understatement to say, he will be missed.\u201d", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F07%2Fgettyimages-463526495.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F07%2Fgettyimages-463526495.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eric King", "July", "At Pm Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/07/31/sam-shepard-dies-celebrities-react/", "title": "Sam Shepard dead: Celebrities react", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Sam Shepard", "news_keywords": "Sam Shepard", "description": "The actor and playwright died at 73", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Sam Shepard Dies at 73: Celebrities Remember the Actor and Playwright", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/07/31/sam-shepard-dies-celebrities-react/", "description": "The actor and playwright died at 73", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F07%2Fgettyimages-463526495.jpg", "width": 1800, "height": 900}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/07/31/sam-shepard-dies-celebrities-react/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F07%2Fgettyimages-463526495.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/07/31/sam-shepard-dies-celebrities-react/", "title": "Sam Shepard Dies at 73: Celebrities Remember the Actor and Playwright", "description": "The actor and playwright died at 73", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F07%2Fgettyimages-463526495.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/07/31/sam-shepard-dies-celebrities-react/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501452000.0, "source": "http://ew.com", "summary": ""}
