That's the sensational claim that's been made in an article by Star Magazine. Apparently, Carey is so upset about her weight gain that she refuses to let Tanaka see her unless she's fully clothed and made up.\n\nBut Gossip Cop, a site that's well known for debunking celebrity rumors, is claiming that the story is nothing but fake news.\n\nAs Gossip Cop reports, Star Magazine has alleged that Mariah Carey gained 60 pounds during the summer and she has been hiding her body from her backup dancer-turned-boyfriend.\n\n\"Bryan has told Mariah that he loves her no matter what she weighs, but Mimi still won't let him see her without clothes on,\" their reported insider said.\n\nThe article goes on to say that Mariah has had special mirrors and lighting installed in her home which make her look thinner than she really is. She has reportedly done this because she thinks that making changes to her home would be easier than changing her body.\n\nBut Gossip Cop contacted Mariah's press rep who has denied that these rumors are true. Mariah's rep says that the story is a fabrication and \"ridiculous.\"", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/5f552c8e-1a98-494f-840e-7bfe35030551.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6d24737c-2349-49d8-a143-a2972008e154.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/75bc5f8f-bdb6-4450-8b34-19f657ce2327.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/182b9846-2813-40a1-8902-1c8cb21bff1c.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/5a8d67e0-f95c-458e-a699-7044c2610778.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dee9f0b262b2cc498f0c56b5221d31a3?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/2236d9db-e4d3-4354-b26e-38352fa5255d.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4488994/is-mariah-carey-forbidding-bryan-tanaka-from-seeing-her-without-clothes-makeup-on-debunked/", "title": "Is Mariah Carey Forbidding Bryan Tanaka From Seeing Her Without Clothes And Makeup On?
