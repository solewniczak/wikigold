But there are some rumors swirling around about the way she got back home.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported that Taylor Swift loaned Grande her plane so that the former Disney star could get back to the States.\n\n\"She then made her way back home with a little help from Taylor Swift, who lent Ariana a private plane so that she could make a quick return to the U.S.,\" The Daily Mail article said.\n\nHowever, although it's nice to think that Taylor Swift was kind enough to lend her fellow pop star a plane so that she could get home safely, Gossip Cop is crying foul over that story.\n\nThe site, well known for debunking celebrity rumors, says that that part of the story is completely made up.\n\nAccording to Gossip Cop, Grande came home on a private flight which was arrange by her manager Scooter Braun and Live Nation. Rapper Mac Miller, Ariana's boyfriend, was there to greet the pop star and her mother when they landed.\n\nWe're not sure why The Daily Mail would include a mention of Taylor Swift in the story since it's not at all relevant to anything else about the bombing at Ariana Grande's concert.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d7bb3a79-5556-4b77-95b6-1e7023672181.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/W4tCBPELsZJiig5WwEg6.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/YkO9RX7cDoMm6hx5W74a.png", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dee9f0b262b2cc498f0c56b5221d31a3?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/9e1eeba9-a8c9-4dbf-bf8e-15ed56ed5931.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4240560/did-ariana-grande-fly-back-to-the-u-s-on-taylor-swifts-plane-after-manchester-bombing-rumors/", "title": "Did Ariana Grande Fly Back To The U.S. On Taylor Swift's Plane After Manchester Bombing?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Did Ariana Grande Fly Back To The U.S. On Taylor Swift's Plane After Manchester Bombing?", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4240560/did-ariana-grande-fly-back-to-the-u-s-on-taylor-swifts-plane-after-manchester-bombing-rumors/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Did Ariana Grande Fly Back To The U.S. On Taylor Swift's Plane After Manchester Bombing?", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-05-24 03:49:02Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "Did Ariana Grande Fly Back To The U.S. On Taylor Swift's Plane After Manchester Bombing?", "keywords": "News, Rumors", "news_keywords": "News, Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495597742.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
