For her eponymous debut album, see Christina Aguilera (album)\n\nNot to be confused with Christina Aguilar\n\nChristina Mar\u00eda Aguilera ( ; Spanish: [a\u0263i\u02c8le\u027ea];[1] born December 18, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and television personality. Known for her four-octave vocal range and ability to sustain high notes,[2] she has been referred to as the \"Voice of a Generation\".[3][4] Aguilera rose to stardom with her eponymous debut album, for which she is credited for influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Her works, which incorporate feminism, sexuality, and domestic violence, have generated both critical praise and controversy, for which she is often cited as an influence by other artists.\n\nAfter appearing in television programs, Aguilera signed with RCA Records in 1998. Her debut album spawned three Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \u2014 \"Genie in a Bottle\", \"What a Girl Wants\" and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\" \u2014 and earned her the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. Established as a bubblegum pop artist, she released her first Spanish record, Mi Reflejo (2000), which topped the Billboard Top Latin Albums for nineteen consecutive weeks. Aguilera assumed artistic control of her fourth studio album Stripped (2002), for which she changed the course of her career; in the music video for \"Dirrty\", she sparked controversy for exploring her sexuality, leading to the departure of her teen idol image. However, \"Beautiful\", \"Fighter\" and \"Can't Hold Us Down\" became top-ten singles in many countries, and she was named the most successful female artist of 2003.\n\nHer fifth album, Back to Basics (2006), was received with favorable reviews and became the second of her career to debut atop of the Billboard 200; singles \"Ain't No Other Man\" and \"Hurt\" reached the top-ten positions in most countries. In 2010, Aguilera starred in the backstage musical Burlesque and contributed to its soundtrack, which produced two Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song nominations. In the following years, she featured in the successful singles \"Feel This Moment\" and \"Say Something\"; in 2011, with \"Moves Like Jagger\", she topped the Billboard Hot 100 in each three decade of her career, which song also became one of the best-selling digital singles. Outside of her work in the music industry, she was named a spokesperson for the World Food Program (WFP), as well made television roles serving as a coach on reality competition show The Voice (2011\u20132016), and as an actress in the drama series Nashville (2015). In 2019, she performed on The Xperience, her first residency show at the Planet Hollywood Las Vegas.\n\nAguilera is considered a pop culture icon and is generally described as a triple threat entertainer.[5][6] With estimated sales over 75 million records, she is recognized as one of the world's best-selling music artists; in 2009, she was classified as the twentieth most successful artist of the 2000s by Billboard. Throughout her career, she has accumulated numerous awards and accolades, including five Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, two MTV Video Music Awards (VMA), one Billboard Music Awards, one Guinness World Record, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and was named a Disney Legend. Aguilera is regarded as one of the most influential Latin artists in the entertainment industry;[7][8] in 2013, Time listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world, as well was ranked as the eighth greatest woman in music by VH1. Furthermore, she has been cited as one of the greatest singers in contemporary pop music, ranked among the greatest of all time by magazines such Rolling Stone and Consequence of Sound.\n\nLife and career\n\n1980\u20131998: Early life and career beginnings\n\nChristina Mar\u00eda Aguilera was born in Staten Island, New York City on December 18, 1980, the eldest of two daughters to musician Shelly Loraine Kearns (n\u00e9e Fidler) and United States Army soldier Fausto Xavier Aguilera.[9] Her father was born in Ecuador, and her mother has German, Irish, Welsh, and Dutch ancestry.[11] Her family moved frequently because of her father's military service, and lived in places including New Jersey, Texas, New York, and Japan.[12] Aguilera stated that her father was physically and emotionally abusive.[13] To cope with her turbulent household, she used music as a form of escape.[14] Following her parents' divorce when she was six years old, Aguilera, her younger sister Rachel, and her mother moved into her grandmother's home in Rochester, a suburb in the Pittsburgh area.[11] Her mother later remarried to Jim Kearns and had a son with him named Michael.[15] After years of estrangement, Aguilera expressed interest in reconciling with her father in 2012.[16]\n\nAs a child, Aguilera was drawn to soul and blues records her grandmother bought and would practice singing, which earned her a reputation as \"the little girl with the big voice\" in her neighborhood.[17] She aspired to be a singer, and won her first talent show at age eight with a rendition of Whitney Houston's \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\".[12] At age 10, she performed \"A Sunday Kind of Love\" on the competition show Star Search, and was eliminated during the semi-final round.[14] She performed the song again on KDKA-TV's Wake Up with Larry Richert. During her youth in the Pittsburgh area, Aguilera sang the US national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", before Pittsburgh Penguins hockey, Pittsburgh Steelers football, and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games, and the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals.[19] She attended Rochester Area School District in Rochester and Marshall Middle School near Wexford, and briefly attended North Allegheny Intermediate High School before being homeschooled to avoid being bullied.[20]\n\nIn 1991, Aguilera auditioned for a position on The Mickey Mouse Club, although she did not meet its age requirements. She joined the television series two years later, where she performed musical numbers and sketch comedy until its cancellation in 1994.[21] Fellow cast members included Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake.[22] After the show ended, Aguilera moved to Japan and recorded her first song, \"All I Wanna Do\", a duet with Japanese singer Keizo Nakanishi.[23] In 1998, Aguilera returned to the US to seek a recording contract. She approached RCA Records, who told her to contact Disney instead because they were having financial difficulties. She sent her cover version of Whitney Houston's \"Run to You\" to Disney in hopes of being selected to record the theme song \"Reflection\" for their animated film Mulan (1998).[25] Aguilera was ultimately selected to sing \"Reflection\"; the song was released in June 1998 and charted on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart at number 15.\n\n1999\u20132001: Christina Aguilera, Mi Reflejo, and My Kind of Christmas\n\nAfter \"Reflection\", Aguilera attracted the attention of RCA's A&R Ron Fair and was signed with the label quickly afterwards.[27][28] RCA was pressured by the contemporary teen pop craze evoked by Aguilera's peer Britney Spears, leading to the label rushing production of the album and aligning Aguilera to be part of the teen pop trend. They released the lead single from the album, \"Genie in a Bottle\", a trendy pop and R&B track, in June 1999. The single rose Aguilera to stardom, peaking atop the US Billboard Hot 100 and charts of 20 other countries.[30] It has sold over seven million copies as of 2014.[31] Aguilera's eponymous debut album followed in August 1999 and peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200.[12] It was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[32] and had moved 17 million copies worldwide by 2010.[33] The album produced three other singles: two US number-one singles \"What a Girl Wants\" and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\", and one US top-five single \"I Turn to You\", a cover of All-4-One's song.[34] At the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in February 2000, Aguilera won Best New Artist.[35]\n\nAguilera's two following studio albums, Mi Reflejo and My Kind of Christmas, were released in September and October 2000, respectively.[36] The former, a Spanish-language album consisting of re-recorded versions of tracks on Aguilera's debut album and several original songs, topped the Billboard Top Latin Albums for 19 consecutive weeks and was certified six times platinum in the Latin field by the RIAA.[32][37] It won Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the 2nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards in 2001.[38] The latter contains covers of Christmas popular songs and a few original dance-pop tunes, and was certified platinum by the RIAA.[32] In support of her albums, Aguilera embarked on her first concert tour, Christina Aguilera in Concert, from mid-2000 to early 2001. The tour visited North America, Europe, South America, and Japan.[40][41] Billboard in 2000 recognized Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of the Year.[42] Despite the successes, Aguilera was displeased with the music and image her manager Steve Kurtz had aligned her to, feeling unable to control her own image.[43] In October 2000, she filed a fiduciary duty lawsuit against Kurtz for improper, undue, and inappropriate influence over her professional activities. After terminating Kurtz's services, RCA hired Irving Azoff as Aguilera's new manager.[44]\n\nAguilera took her first steps in artistic control with a cover of Labelle's \"Lady Marmalade\" (1974) with Pink, M\u00fda, and Lil' Kim for the Moulin Rouge! soundtrack.[17] RCA executives initially opposed to Aguilera recording \"Lady Marmalade\" because it was \"too urban\", but Aguilera ultimately managed to record the song of her own accord.[43] The collaboration topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks based on airplay alone, becoming the first airplay-only track in history to remain on the chart's top spot for more than one week.[45][46] It won Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards.[47] In mid-2001, Warlock Records released Just Be Free, a compilation of demo tracks Aguilera recorded in 1994 and 1995, when she was looking forward to an album release after the end of The Mickey Mouse Club. Aguilera filed a suit against Warlock Records and the album's producers to stop the release. The two parties came to a confidential settlement to release the album, in which Aguilera lent out her name, likeness, and image for an unspecified amount of damages.[49]\n\n2002\u20132003: Stripped\n\nWhile working on her fourth studio album, Aguilera leaned toward a new artistic direction that she felt had more musical and lyrical depth.[50] She named the album Stripped and explained that the title represented \"a new beginning, a re-introduction of [herself] as a new artist in a way\".[51] Aguilera served as the album's executive producer and co-wrote most of the songs.[52][53] To present her new persona, Aguilera released \"Dirrty\" as the lead single from the album in September 2002.[54] Its accompanying music video generated controversy for depicting overtly sexual fetishes.[55] Aguilera's new image presented in the video was widely criticized by the public that it began to overshadow her music.[56][57][58] She defended her new image: \"I'm in the power position, in complete command of everything and everybody around me. To be totally balls-out like that is, for me, the measure of a true artist.\"[58]\n\nStripped was released in October 2002.[59] The album incorporated various genres from R&B and flamenco to rock, and lyrically revolves around the theme of self-esteem while also discussing sex and gender equality.[53][60] It received mixed reviews from music critics, who viewed the employment of various musical styles incoherent, but praised Aguilera's vocals.[59][60] The album peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and has sold over 4.3 million copies in the US as of 2014.[61] In the UK, the album has sold two million copies as of 2017 and was the second highest-selling album by an American female artist during the 2000s decade, behind Norah Jones with Come Away with Me.[62][63] By 2006, Stripped had sold over 12 million copies worldwide.[64] The second single from the album, the ballad \"Beautiful\", received universal acclaim for its empowering lyrics about embracing inner beauty, and became an anthem for the LGBT community.[65][66] It was the album's best-charting single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[34] The song won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards in 2004.[67]\n\nStripped was followed by three other singles: \"Fighter\", \"Can't Hold Us Down\", and \"The Voice Within\", all of which were released in 2003 and entered the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100.[34] During promotion of Stripped, Aguilera cultivated a new image by adopting the alter ego Xtina, dyeing her hair black, and debuting several tattoos and piercings.[68][69] She co-headlined the Justified and Stripped Tour alongside Justin Timberlake from June to September 2003 in support of Stripped and Timberlake's album Justified (2002), before embarking on her solo Stripped Tour until December.[70][71] Aguilera attended the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in August, where she and Britney Spears kissed Madonna during their performance of \"Like a Virgin\" and \"Hollywood\", which received considerable media attention.[72] She was the host of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, where she won Best Female award, in November.[73] Billboard announced Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of 2003.[74]\n\n2004\u20132009: Marriage, Back to Basics, and first child\n\nIn 2004, Aguilera recorded a revised version of Rose Royce's \"Car Wash\" (1976) with Missy Elliott for the animated film Shark Tale, in which she was a voice actress,[75] and contributed vocals to Nelly's single \"Tilt Ya Head Back\".[76] She was a featured artist on Herbie Hancock's 2005 cover of Leon Russell's \"A Song for You\" (1970), which was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2006.[77] During this time, Aguilera started working on her follow-up studio album and embraced a new image inspired by figures of the Classic Hollywood era such as Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich, and Mary Pickford, debuting blonde curly hair and retro-styled makeup.[78][79]\n\nAguilera became engaged to marketing executive Jordan Bratman, who had dated her since 2003, in February 2005.[80] They married on November 19, 2005, at an estate in Napa County, California.[81] Aguilera released the lead single, \"Ain't No Other Man\", from her fifth studio album, Back to Basics, in June 2006.[82] The song, like the majority of the album, was inspired by Aguilera's marriage and incorporates elements of early 20th-century soul, blues, and jazz.[83][84] It reached number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and has sold 1.7 million digital copies in the US as of 2014.[34][61] Its music video saw Aguilera debuting her new alter ego, Baby Jane, inspired by the thriller film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962).[82]\n\nBack to Basics was released in August 2006. Aguilera described the record, a double album, as a \"throwback\" to jazz, blues, and soul music of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s that incorporates \"a modern twist.\"[85] She was much inspired by works of such classic blues and soul singers as Otis Redding, Millie Jackson, and Nina Simone during the recording sessions.[86] Back to Basics received generally positive reviews from critics, who commented that the retro-oriented production complements Aguilera's vocals.[87] It debuted atop the Billboard 200 and has sold 1.7 million copies in the US.[61] At the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2007, Aguilera won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Ain't No Other Man\" and performed \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\" as a tribute to the late James Brown.[88] Back to Basics was succeeded by two international top-ten singles: \"Hurt\" and \"Candyman\". Two other singles, \"Slow Down Baby\" and \"Oh Mother\", were released exclusively in Australia[89] and Europe,[90] respectively. In support of Back to Basics, Aguilera embarked on the Back to Basics Tour, which ran from November 2006 to October 2008.[91][92][93] With US$48.1 million grossed, the tour was the highest-grossing solo female tour of 2007.[94]\n\nIn January 2008, a son named Max was born to Aguilera and Bratman.[95] Later that year, she appeared in the Martin Scorsese documentary Shine a Light chronicling a two-day concert by The Rolling Stones in New York City's Beacon Theatre, in which Aguilera performs \"Live with Me\" alongside the band's lead vocalist Mick Jagger.[96] In commemoration of a decade-long career in the music industry, Aguilera released a greatest hits album titled Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits exclusively through Target in November 2008, in the US.[97] In addition to previous singles, it includes four original electropop-oriented songs, two of which are remade versions of two previous singles.[98][99] Aguilera commented that the newly recorded tracks' \"futurisic, robotic sound\" served as a preview for her follow-up studio album.[100] Keeps Gettin' Better peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200, and its titular single \"Keeps Gettin' Better\" charted at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100.[34] Billboard in 2009 recognized Aguilera as the 20th most successful artist of the 2000s.[101]\n\n2010\u20132011: Bionic, Burlesque, and The Voice\n\nAguilera began working on her sixth studio album during her pregnancy when she frequently listened to electronic music.[102] The lead single from the album, \"Not Myself Tonight\", was released in March 2010.[103] Heavily influenced by electronic genres, the song signaled Aguilera's musical experiments on her forthcoming album.[104] It peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100.[34] The album, titled Bionic, was released in June 2010. Categorized as a R&B-flavored futurepop album by critics,[105][106] Bionic lyrically revolves around sexual themes while also discussing feminism.[107] Critical reaction to the album was mixed; reviewers commended Aguilera's experimentation with new styles, but found it forced and unnatural.[108][109][110] The album peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and has sold 332,000 copies in the US as of 2019.[111] The album spawned one other international single, \"You Lost Me\". Two other singles from the album, \"Woohoo\" featuring rapper Nicki Minaj and \"I Hate Boys\", were released in the US and Europe,[112][113] and Australia, respectively.[114]\n\nAguilera starred alongside Cher in the musical film Burlesque.[115] Written and directed by Steve Antin, the film was released in theaters in November 2010.[116] Aguilera played Ali Rose, who quits her bar service job and moves to Los Angeles, where she aspires to be a performer in a burlesque club owned by Tess Scali (Cher). Burlesque grossed US$90 million in the box office[117] and received mixed reviews from critics, who found it clich\u00e9d but praised Aguilera's acting.[118] The film received a nomination for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy at the 68th Golden Globe Awards.[119] Aguilera recorded eight tracks for the film's ten-track accompanying soundtrack, and Cher performed the other two.[120] The soundtrack reached number 18 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA.[32][34]\n\nAt Super Bowl XLV in February 2011, Aguilera omitted a few lines while performing the US national anthem.[121] She apologized for the incident, saying: \"I got so caught up in the moment of the song that I lost my place.\"[122] At the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, she performed alongside Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride, Yolanda Adams, and Florence Welch in a segment that paid tribute to soul singer Aretha Franklin.[123] Aguilera finalized her divorce from Jordan Bratman, from whom she had been separated since September 2010, on April 15, 2011.[124] She concurrently started dating Matthew Rutler, an assistant on the set of Burlesque.[125] From April 2011 to December 2012, Aguilera served as a coach on the first three seasons of the television competition series The Voice.[126] During the first season, Aguilera was featured on Maroon 5's single \"Moves like Jagger\" upon the invitation of the group's lead vocalist and Aguilera's fellow The Voice coach Adam Levine. The single peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[127][32]\n\n2012\u20132017: Lotus, second child, and television projects\n\nUpon the third season of The Voice in September 2012, Aguilera released \"Your Body\" as the lead single from her seventh studio album.[128] The single charted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 34.[129] The album, titled Lotus, followed in November 2012. Aguilera described the record as a \"rebirth\" of herself after the personal struggles she overcame.[68] Contemporary reviewers found the album generic and conventional, as opposed to Aguilera's previous experimental ventures.[130][131] Lotus peaked at number seven on the Billboard 200 and has sold 303,000 copies in the US as of 2019.[111] The album was supported by another single, \"Just a Fool\", featuring Aguilera's fellow The Voice coach Blake Shelton.[132] In December 2012, Aguilera was replaced by Shakira for the fourth season of The Voice due to wanting to focus on solo projects.[133] She returned for the fifth season in September 2013.[134]\n\nIn 2013, Aguilera scored three international top-ten singles.

On October 21, Aguilera released \"Pa Mis Muchachas\", with Becky G, Nicki Nicole and Nathy Peluso.[179] On November 19, Aguilera debuted the second single, \"Somos Nada\", at the 22nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards and performed it and \"Pa' Mis Muchachas\" alongside Becky, Nicole and Peluso.[180][181] On December 7, 2021, Aguilera was honored with the first-ever Music Icon award at the 47th People's Choice Awards and performed a melody of hits as well as \"Somos Nada\".[182] On January 20, 2022, Aguilera released \"Santo\", a collaboration with Ozuna, as the third single.[183]\n\nArtistry\n\nVoice\n\nCritics have described Aguilera as a soprano,[184][185][2] possessing a four-octave vocal range (from C 3 to C\u266f 7 ),[186][187][188] being also able to perform the whistle register.[189] After the release of her self-titled debut album, Ron Fair \u2014 executive of RCA Records \u2014 said he was betting on the singer due to her \"perfect intonation\", considering that she had \"pipes to be the next Barbra Streisand or C\u00e9line Dion\".[190] In an article for Slate, Maura Johnston opined that although the singer acts in the contemporary pop music, she has \"an instrument that despite its ability to leap octaves has a low-end grounding similar to that possessed by opera singers\".[191] Highlighting her vocal versatility, Joan Anderman from The Boston Globe stated that she is \"a real singer [...] blessed with the sort of breathtaking elasticity, golden tones, and sheer power that separate the divas from the dabblers\".[192] Aguilera is also recognized for making use of melisma in her songs and performances;[193][194] Jon Pareles, writing for The New York Times, analyzed her vocal abilities, emphasizing that \"she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas\".[195] According to critics of Rolling Stone magazine, she has been modeled her \"dramatic and melismatic technique\" following steps of artists like Etta James.[196]\n\nThroughout her career, her vocal ability has yielded comparisons with other vocalists. As a result of her use of melismatic technique, David Browne associated her with Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, opining that the three form the team of the main proponents of this vocal modality.[198] Sharing the same point of view, Sasha Frere-Jones, columnist for The New Yorker, expressed that the technique was responsible for making her a \"serious singer\" without needing to \"reincarnate the Sarah Vaughan\".[199] Steve Kipner \u2014 songwriter of \"Genie in a Bottle\" (1999) \u2014 considered that Aguilera has an \"impressive\" vocal dexterity, being able to \"internalized all the riffs from Chaka Khan\".[190] Ann Powers, critic from Los Angeles Times, said that Aguilera has a voice \"purely powerful as that of Etta James [...] and she's moving toward the expressiveness of Gladys Knight, if not Aretha Franklin\"; however, Powers notes that her vocal ability in ballad songs \"connects her to Barbra Streisand\", in addition to comparing her to Donna Summer when she works on songs influenced by rhythm and blues.[200]\n\nHowever, Aguilera has also been criticized for the excessive use of melisma, as well for oversinging in her songs and concerts.[201][202][203] Writing for The Huffington Post, John Eskow stated that she is the main proponent of \"oversouling\" and, despite recognizing that she has a \"great instrument\", opined that she \"don't seem to know when to stop\" with the use of \"gratuitous and confected melisma\".[204] Lucy Davies, author from BBC Music, acknowledges that Aguilera has a \"stunning voice\", but indicated that \"she could be more varied, simply by cutting out some of the 'y-e-e-eeeh, woah yeh's' in her songs\".[205] During the recording session of \"Beautiful\" (2002), Linda Perry recalled that the singer had difficulty in avoiding what she calls \"vocal improvisations\", stopping the recording every time she started to \"oversinging\"; Perry ended up using the song's first take, saying, \"She had a hard time accepting that as the final track. She's a perfectionist. She knows her voice really well and she knows what's going on. She can hear things that nobody else would catch\".[206] In an article for Entertainment Weekly, Chris Willman opined that the Aguilera's tendency to oversinging is due to the influence of Carey in her vocal abilities, noting \"her slightly nasal tone that really only becomes obvious when she's overselling a song\".[207] VH1 writer Alexa Tietjen added that Aguilera \"does tend to take it to the extreme at times [...] but Christina's vocal prowess is what's gotten her so far.
