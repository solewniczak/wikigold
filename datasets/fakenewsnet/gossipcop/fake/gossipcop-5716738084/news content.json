Chris Pratt's split from actress Anna Faris after eight years of marriage.\n\n\n\nAs the couple confirmed their separation on Facebook earlier this week, fans took to social media to blame Lawrence, who starred in Passengers with Prattin 2016, for the split, according to reports from The Daily Mail online.\n\nI give it 6 weeks before it's announced Jennifer Lawrence & Chris Pratt are dating after his split from Anna Faris \u2014 Colonel Kickhead (@colonelkickhead) August 7, 2017\n\n\"I can't believe Chris Pratt and Anna Faris are splitting up, this is all Jennifer Lawrence's fault,\" one fan wrote on Twitter.\n\nDespite there being no suggestion that Lawrence had any involvement in the split, another wrote: \"Jennifer Lawrence broke up Chris Pratt's marriage\".\n\n__________________________\n\nREAD MORE\n\nChris Pratt and Anna Faris announce separation\n\nShowbiz relationship splits we didn't see coming\n\nFilm review: Morten Tyldum\u2019s sci-fi
