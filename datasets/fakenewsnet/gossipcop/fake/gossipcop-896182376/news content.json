The former couple rose to fame when they starred in the popular vampire-themed film series called Twilight. Now, rumors have it that the two could possibly get reunited again in a brand new project.\n\nAn OK! Magazine insider, as cited by Hollywood Life, claimed that Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson have met again after several years since their infamous split. The tipster stated that the former co-stars are planning to work together on a new movie. The same source said the project would be different from the Twilight series, which was based on the novels of Stephenie Meyer.\n\n\"Kristen is more hesitant than Rob right now, but they've agreed to discuss it. Separately, they'd each jump at it, but working together isn't an easy yes for them given the fan hysteria that surrounded their split years ago.\"\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop was quick to debunk the claims. The publication revealed that Kristen Stewart does not have plans to quit acting to become a full-time director anytime soon. The news outlet suggested that the wrongful speculations sparked after the former girlfriend of Robert Pattinson made her directorial debut last year during the Sundance Film Festival. Reports about the actress co-authoring a case study about neural style transfer have also added fuel to the rumors.", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fed4959c-fb17-4183-9a69-aa4c161aa162.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/W4tCBPELsZJiig5WwEg6.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/YkO9RX7cDoMm6hx5W74a.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d7bb3a79-5556-4b77-95b6-1e7023672181.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7203b89913763ccf66c16beb9c3a7020?s=800"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4766138/kristen-stewart-robert-pattinson-2018-actress-rumored-to-direct-their-next-film-together-and-quit-acting/", "title": "Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson 2018: Actress Rumored To Direct Their Next Film Together And Quit Acting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson 2018: Actress Rumored To Direct Their Next Film Together And Quit Acting", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4766138/kristen-stewart-robert-pattinson-2018-actress-rumored-to-direct-their-next-film-together-and-quit-acting/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson 2018: Actress Rumored To Direct Their Next Film Together And Quit Acting", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-02-03 03:44:38Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson 2018: Actress Rumored To Direct Their Next Film Together And Quit Acting", "keywords": "Rumors", "news_keywords": "Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517629478.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
