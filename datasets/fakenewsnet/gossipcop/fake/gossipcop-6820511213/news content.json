The Prince of Wales (Prince Charles)\n\n2. The Duke of Cambridge (Prince William)\n\n3. Prince George of Cambridge\n\n4. Princess Charlotte of Cambridge\n\n5. Prince Louis of Cambridge\n\n6. Prince Henry of Wales (Prince Harry)\n\n7. Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor\n\n8. Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor\n\n9. The Duke of York (Prince Andrew)\n\n10. Princess Beatrice of York\n\n11. Sienna Mapelli Mozzi\n\n12. Princess Eugenie of York\n\n13. August Philip Hawke Brooksbank\n\n14. The Earl of Wessex (Prince Edward)\n\n15. James, Viscount Severn\n\n16. The Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor\n\n17. The Princess Royal (Princess Anne)\n\n18. Mr Peter Phillips\n\n19. Miss Savannah Phillips\n\n20. Miss Isla Phillips\n\nThis system, which dated back 300 years, is based on the rules of primogeniture which gives preference to the firstborn male heirs of a king or queen.\n\nThis change in royal succession means Princess Charlotte, as William and Kate's daughter, is ahead of her younger brother.\n\nPreviously if the third child was male he would leap the princess in the line of succession.\n\nThis new rule only takes into account children born after 2011, meaning Prince Edward's youngest child, James, born in 2007, is ahead of his older sister, Louise, born in 2003.\n\n3 Prince George is third in line to the throne followed by his sister Charlotte and his brother Louis\n\nCan the monarch marry a Catholic?\n\nYes, a monarch can marry a Catholic.\n\nCommonwealth leaders decided in 2011 to remove the rule that no heir could assume the throne if he or she married a Roman Catholic.\n\nThen-Prime Minister David Cameron said at the time: \u201cThe idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter, simply because he is a man just isn\u2019t acceptable anymore.\n\n\"Nor does it make any sense that a potential monarch can marry someone of any faith other than Catholic.\n\n\u201cThe thinking behind these rules is wrong.\"\n\nThe Roman Catholic rule can be traced to the 16th-century reign of Henry VIII.\n\nThe King broke with the Roman Catholic Church so he could divorce his wife, Queen Catherine, and marry Anne Boleyn after the Pope refused his divorce request.\n\nWill Prince Charles step aside and let Prince William become King?\n\nAt 72-years-old, Prince Charles is the longest-serving heir in UK history - having been first in line from the age of three.\n\nWhen he takes the crown Prince Charles will become the oldest ever British monarch to take the throne.\n\nSome royalists have argued that Prince Charles should step aside to allow Prince William to become King because he enjoys better approval ratings with the public based on a 2016 poll.\n\nPrince Charles has faced controversy over his divorce from Princess Diana and his affair during their marriage with now-wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nHe has also been accused of \u201cmeddling\u201d in politics by stating his opinion on issues like the environment and farming, alternative medicine and architecture in private letters to Government ministers.\n\nIn 1936, Edward VIII - the Queen's uncle - famously abdicated after less than a year on the throne so he could marry divorcee Wallis Simpson.\n\nWhy was Prince Philip not a king?\n\nDue to English common laws, Prince Philip could not become king.\n\nThe wife of a king is known as a Queen Consort and takes the title of Queen \u2013 although she doesn\u2019t rule as the monarch.\n\nBut if a female royal marries a man with a title below her own - as in the case of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip - she will retain the title while her husband will not be entitled to it.\n\nHe was known as Prince Consort.", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/themes/thesun/images/sunmasthead.svg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ROYAL-Portrait-15412388jpg-JS551419970.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 1.3 1\"%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Meghan-2-1.jpg?strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/dk-comp-clemmie-14mar.jpg?strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 1.8 1\"%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NINTCHDBPICT000719137796.jpg?strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sunmasthead_mobile.png", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-6ffcb4e6ef.jpg?strip=all&w=160&h=90&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 1.6 1\"%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Royals-1.jpg?strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "http://www.facebook.com/tr?id=752905198150451&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ROYAL-Portrait-15412388jpg-JS551419970.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Bell", "Niamh Cavanagh", "Paul Harper"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/3856958/next-line-throne-royal-succession-explained/", "title": "Who\u2019s next in line to the throne?
