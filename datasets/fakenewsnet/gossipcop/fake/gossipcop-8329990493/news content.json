Sure, Lakers player Jordan Clarkson is cute and nice, but Kim allegedly doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s famous enough to date Kendall!\n\n\u201cKim [Kardashian] thinks Jordan [Clarkson] isn\u2019t famous enough [to date Kendall Jenner],\u201d a source told Life & Style magazine. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy, but he barely has 150,000 followers on Twitter and she\u2019d never heard of him until Kendall brought him up. [She] told Kendall that dating Jordan isn\u2019t a smart move, and that she should be dating a famous rapper or musician if she wants to gain popularity.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: a source has told HollywoodLife.com that this is not true.\n\nWow! To think that having 150,000 followers on Twitter is something to be ashamed of! Kim, 35, has incredibly high standards for herself, and she wants Kendall, 20, to find a guy who\u2019s her equal, just like she did with husband Kanye West, 38. But calling 24-year-old Jordan un-famous is pretty unfair. He\u2019s an NBA star who plays for the Lakers, for goodness sake!\n\nKim should realize that the heart wants what it wants! After all, she once married a not-so famous basketball star and\u2026okay that\u2019s not the best example. But still! Kim shouldn\u2019t get too concerned just yet, as Kendall and Jordan are reportedly keeping things casual at the moment. They\u2019re hanging out together when they\u2019re both in town, according to a source who spoke to E! News, and still seeing other people.\n\nThat must be why Kendall was spotted grinding on Moises Arias, 22, during a party on July 15 that Jordan was also attending! A partygoer at the OUE Skyspace LA outdoor lounge launch party in LA, though, told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Moises made the moves, but Kendall wasn\u2019t too into it. Is Moises famous enough for Kim\u2019s approval?\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Kendall and Jordan should date?
