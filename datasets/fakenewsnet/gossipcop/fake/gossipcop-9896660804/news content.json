Although they are said to be uncertain about the future, Khloe has been attending all of Tristan's home games.", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a1aab41ece6a274bcaecb11bc798ff5?s=800", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Khloe-Kardashian-Gets-Tristan-Thompsons-Exs-Support-Amid-Cheating-Scandal.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/W4tCBPELsZJiig5WwEg6.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/YkO9RX7cDoMm6hx5W74a.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d7bb3a79-5556-4b77-95b6-1e7023672181.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/9e1eeba9-a8c9-4dbf-bf8e-15ed56ed5931.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Khloe-Kardashian-Gets-Tristan-Thompsons-Exs-Support-Amid-Cheating-Scandal.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4913434/khloe-kardashian-didnt-get-banned-from-cleveland-cavaliers-games-debunked/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Didn't Get Banned From Cleveland Cavaliers Games [DeBunked]", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Didn't Get Banned From Cleveland Cavaliers Games [DeBunked]", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4913434/khloe-kardashian-didnt-get-banned-from-cleveland-cavaliers-games-debunked/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Khloe Kardashian Didn't Get Banned From Cleveland Cavaliers Games [DeBunked]", "image": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Khloe-Kardashian-Gets-Tristan-Thompsons-Exs-Support-Amid-Cheating-Scandal.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-05-24 22:31:10Z", "section": "Fact Checking"}, "description": "Khloe Kardashian Didn't Get Banned From Cleveland Cavaliers Games [DeBunked]", "keywords": "Fact Checking", "news_keywords": "Fact Checking", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527201070.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
