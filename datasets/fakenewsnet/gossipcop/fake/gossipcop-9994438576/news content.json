Rumors that Katie might be expecting her first child with the actor began circulating after reports suggested the former Dawson's Creek star had been telling her friends that she and Foxx were going to have a baby.\n\nAccording to a May 14 report by Gossip Cop, the rumors about Katie Holmes being pregnant with Jamie Foxx's child is completely untrue. A rep for the actress has reportedly confirmed to the website that she is \"not expecting\" a child at all.\n\nThe pregnancy rumors began when a source allegedly told Woman's Day that Katie Holmes had been telling her close friends she was expecting Jamie Foxx's child after months of not drinking alcohol and wearing bagging clothing. The report reveals that Katie finally confessed her pregnancy, and revealed that she and Jamie were expecting a baby girl and that the child was due in December.\n\nThe report also claimed that Katie Holmes had been suffering from some health complications during the alleged pregnancy, and was required to be on bed rest. However, the insider added that she was feeling much better and that Jamie had been going to \"every single doctor's appointment\" with her. However, the pregnancy news simply isn't true according to Holmes' camp.", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Jamie-Foxx-Katie-Holmes.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/b5c635af-0182-490b-9ed0-70d493ce0bd7.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/75bc5f8f-bdb6-4450-8b34-19f657ce2327.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6d24737c-2349-49d8-a143-a2972008e154.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/2236d9db-e4d3-4354-b26e-38352fa5255d.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/5a8d67e0-f95c-458e-a699-7044c2610778.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a1aab41ece6a274bcaecb11bc798ff5?s=800"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Jamie-Foxx-Katie-Holmes.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4899991/katie-holmes-is-not-pregnant-with-jamie-foxxs-child-debunked/", "title": "Katie Holmes Is Not Pregnant With Jamie Foxx's Child [Debunked]", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Katie Holmes Is Not Pregnant With Jamie Foxx's Child [Debunked]", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4899991/katie-holmes-is-not-pregnant-with-jamie-foxxs-child-debunked/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Katie Holmes Is Not Pregnant With Jamie Foxx's Child [Debunked]", "image": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Jamie-Foxx-Katie-Holmes.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-05-14 13:26:34Z", "section": "Fact Checking"}, "description": "Katie Holmes Is Not Pregnant With Jamie Foxx's Child [Debunked]", "keywords": "Fact Checking", "news_keywords": "Fact Checking", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526304394.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
