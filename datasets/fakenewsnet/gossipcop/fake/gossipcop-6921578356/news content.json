The model, 29, opened up about the experience and what she worried about most about her ex\u2019s wedding to Meghan Markle in a column for U.K. magazine The Spectator.\n\n\u201cFriends are starting to get married, which means the dilemma of British wedding attire. Hats,\u201d Bonas admitted. \u201cWhy do I find hats so tricky? Tricky to wear, tricky to look at, and extremely tricky for the poor soul sitting in the pew behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the time I avoid headgear,\u201d she revealed. \u201cThis can prompt disapproving looks from the older generations. Last weekend I attended the royal wedding. The invitation clearly stated that guests must wear hats. Yikes.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI opted for a minimal feathered number \u2014 and can only hope I got it right.\u201d\n\nBonas dated Harry, 33, for two years after being introduced to him by his cousin Princess Eugenie.\n\nThe wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Pre-Ceremony, Windsor, Berkshire, UK - 19 May 2018 Chelsy Davy arriving with friends a Prince Harry\u2019s wedding to Meghan Markle | Credit: James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe two parted ways amicably in 2014. He also invited former girlfriend Chelsy Davy, who he dated on-and-off from 2004 to 2011.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Harry and Meghan\u2019s Love Story\n\nIt was reportedly a dislike of the media attention and

said that she and Harry still kept in touch. \u201cI think we will always be good friends,\u201d she told The Sunday Times style section.\n\nWhile it is not common for commoners to invite their former lovers to their nuptials, there\u2019s royal precedent for inviting your exes to your big day.", "images":
