The rapper is reportedly completely ignoring his duties as a new dad in the weeks since the couple\u2019s daughter, Chicago West, was born. Just days after Chicago\u2019s birth, Kanye jetted off to New York for several days, leaving Kim home alone with all three kids, and when he is home, he\u2019s been refusing to change diapers or wake up for late night feedings, according to Star. \u201cKim let it slide the first time, but she was counting on counting on Kanye to help out around the house because she already has her hands full,\u201d the mag\u2019s insider claims. \u201cKim was furious when Kanye told her to just hire another nanny. She made it clear that he petter start pulling his weight \u2014 or else.\u201d\n\nChicago was born via surrogate on Jan. 15, and is just one of the newest additions to the Kardashian family. On Feb. 1, Kylie Jenner, 20, gave birth to her first child \u2014 a baby girl named Stormi Webster. That means Kim and Kylie\u2019s daughters are less than one month apart, and Kim wrote the sweetest message to her little sis about it. \u201cI\u2019m so incredibly proud of the woman you have grown up to be and I know that you are going to be the best mom to your new baby girl!\u201d she gushed. \u201cOur girls are two weeks apart and I can\u2019t wait for them to be besties! I am so proud that you do what you want to do and live your life the way you want you will pass down all of those amazing qualities to your baby girl. You were made to be a mom!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Khloe Kardashian is currently pregnant with her first child, and is due at the end of March/beginning of April \u2014 so there\u2019ll be another little one added to the mix in just a couple of months!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Kanye will step up as a dad?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/alyssa_norwin.jpg?w=48", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/taylor.jpg?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bella-Hadid-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=4630073&action=edit", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-practice-presentation.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kim-kardashian-furious-kanye-wont-change-diapers-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brigitte-nielson-wraps-arm-around-husband-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kim-kardashian-furious-kanye-wont-change-diapers-ftr.jpg", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AP21265583383493_1440x1080.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nicole-leans-rafe-days-of-our-lives-jj.jpg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/evan-rachel-wood-and-marilyn-manson-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/massage-gun-adobe-stock-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kim-kardashian-furious-kanye-wont-change-diapers-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Norwin", "Thea Glassman", "Jason Pham", "Nikki Brown", "Amy Mistretta", "Richard Simms", "Deputy Editor Of New York City"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/02/07/kanye-west-changing-diapers-kim-kardashian-fight-baby-chicago/", "title": "Kanye West Reportedly Refuses To Change Chicago\u2019s Diapers & Kim Is Furious With Him", "meta_data": {"description": "Kanye West has reportedly not been changing Chicago West's diapers or pitching in with caring for her...and Kim Kardashian is livid.", "news_keywords": "chicago-west, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 5.9.2", "author": "Alyssa Norwin", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Hollywood Life", "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kanye West Reportedly Refuses To Change Chicago\u2019s Diapers & Kim Is Furious With Him", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/02/07/kanye-west-changing-diapers-kim-kardashian-fight-baby-chicago/", "description": "Despite having a new baby at home, Kanye West has been M.I.A., leaving Kim Kardashian to care for their newborn herself \u2014 and the reality star is livid, according to a new report.", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kim-kardashian-furious-kanye-wont-change-diapers-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 349, "alt": "kim kardashian kanye west"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-07T17:07:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-07T20:33:06+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Kanye West Reportedly Refuses To Change Chicago\u2019s Diapers & Kim Is Furious With Him"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kim-kardashian-furious-kanye-wont-change-diapers-ftr.jpg?w=620", "alt": "kim kardashian kanye west"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HollywoodLife", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/alyssanorwin/", "title": "Kanye West Reportedly Refuses To Change Chicago\u2019s Diapers & Kim Is Furious With Him", "description": "Kanye West has reportedly not been changing Chicago West's diapers or pitching in with caring for her...and Kim Kardashian is livid."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517958000.0, "source": "http://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
