She expanded her family \u2014 her dog family, that is. Her two Italian greyhounds, Norman and Bambi, had surprise babies!\n\n\u201cMy babies had babies!\u201d she gushed. \u201cCan\u2019t you handle how cute little Harlie and Rosie are?!\u201d\n\nJenner also hit a few milestones in her professional life, starting with the creation of The Kylie Shop (\u201cCreating my own merch was a dream come true for me!\u201d) and her booming cosmetics company.
