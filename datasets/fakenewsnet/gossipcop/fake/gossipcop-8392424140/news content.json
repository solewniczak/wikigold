The emotional track makes it very clear that he\u2019s missing his ex big time. So, is he going hard to get her back? Here\u2019s what we know!\n\nKaty Perry, 32, and John Mayer, 39, had a very intense \u2014 and tumultuous \u2014 relationship. They dated on and off from August 2012 until they finally split for good in 2015. Katy moved on to Orlando Bloom, 40, and it seemed like John was history. But a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that John has never given up on winning her back.\n\n\u201cJohn was practically jumping for joy when he found out about her breakup with Orlando,\u201d says our source. \u201cSince then he\u2019s been bombarding her with calls and flowers. He\u2019s written her poetry and songs, getting her back is all her cares about these days.\u201d So sweet!\n\nJohn has a history of going hot and cold on Katy so we\u2019re not surprised that she hasn\u2019t gone running straight back to him. But his new song \u2018Still Feel Like Your Man\u2019 has got to be pulling at her heart strings a little. With lyrics like \u201cI still keep your shampoo in my shower, in case you want to wash your hair\u201d and \u201cStill think I\u2019m never going to find another you,\u201d the song is a serious tear jerker.\n\nBut John isn\u2019t stopping with love songs and flowers, he\u2019s also started talking babies! The sexy singer just opened up to The New York Times and revealed that he\u2019s ready to settle down and have a family. \u201cThat\u2019s the final frontier, man,\u201d he admitted. We love that John is finally growing up \u2014 but only time will tell if Katy\u2019s willing to give him another chance.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Katy should take John back? Or will he break her heart all over again?
