(Katie Falkenberg / Los Angeles Times)\n\nFollowing news this week that the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival had booked Radiohead, Kendrick Lamar and Beyonc\u00e9 to lead its 2017 lineup, the owner of the company that oversees the festival\u2019s organizers has come under fire for his political interests.\n\nAccording to a widely picked-up report in Uproxx, Philip F. Anschutz, the owner of AEG, whose AEG Live division is the world\u2019s second largest presenter of live music, sports and entertainment after Live Nation, has donated to a number of anti-LGBTQ groups such as Alliance Defending Freedom, National Christian Foundation and Family Research Council.\n\nA number of these organizations have been listed as \u201cextremist groups\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nBecause AEG Live oversees Coachella promoter Goldenvoice, people have taken to social media to question if anyone should drop hundreds of dollars for the destination festival out of fear that their money would fund anti-gay groups. General admission passes to Coachella sold out in an hour on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement to The Times on Thursday, Anschutz said he was unaware of the anti-LGBTQ work done by any of the organizations he had supported and that he had ceased all contributions after learning.\n\n\u201cRecent claims published in the media that I am anti-LGBTQ are nothing more than fake news \u2013 it is all garbage. I unequivocally support the rights of all people without regard to sexual orientation,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe are fortunate to employ a wealth of diverse individuals throughout our family of companies, all of whom are important to us \u2013 the only criteria on which they are judged is the quality of their job performance; we do not tolerate discrimination in any form.\u201d\n\nAnschutz is one of the richest people in America, amassing fortunes in oil, railroads, telecom and real estate on top of his entertainment endeavors (he came in at No. 42 on Forbes\u2019 U.S. billionaires list last year) and the conservative dealings of his foundation were reported by the Washington Post over the summer in a piece that labeled him as one of the \u201cenemies of equality.\u201d\n\nHis foundation was said to have donated $110,000 to Alliance Defending Freedom, a group that \u201cadvocates for your right to freely live out your faith\u201d; $50,000 to National Christian Foundation, an organization that funds groups that have worked to fight LGBT rights; and $30,000 to Family Research Council, which is labeled as an \u201cextremist group\u201d by the SPLC. The contributions were made between 2010 and 2013.\n\nAnschutz said he and his foundation contribute to numerous organizations \u201cthat pursue a wide range of causes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither I nor the Foundation fund any organization with the purpose or expectation that it would finance anti-LGBTQ initiatives,\u201d the statement continued, \u201cand when it has come to my attention or the attention of The Anschutz Foundation that certain organizations either the Foundation or I have funded have been supporting such causes, we have immediately ceased all contributions to such groups.\u201d", "images": ["https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7046e4f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F57d858144a2a88575fa2b03080bb%2Flatlogo-ss.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7046e4f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F57d858144a2a88575fa2b03080bb%2Flatlogo-ss.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-january-2017-htmlstory.html", "title": "Today in Entertainment: Oprah Winfrey to join \u201860 Minutes\u2019 as contributor; AFI voices support for Asghar Farhadi", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Today in Entertainment: Oprah Winfrey to join '60 Minutes' as contributor; AFI voices support for Asghar Farhadi", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-january-2017-htmlstory.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7046e4f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F57d858144a2a88575fa2b03080bb%2Flatlogo-ss.jpg", "url": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7046e4f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F57d858144a2a88575fa2b03080bb%2Flatlogo-ss.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg", "alt": "LA Times logo"}, "description": "Major award shows such as the Grammys and the Oscars are right around the corner, but much of the arts and entertainment world is spending more time reacting to the new presidency of Donald Trump and his recent executive order on immigration.
