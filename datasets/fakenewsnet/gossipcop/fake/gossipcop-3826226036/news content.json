Subscribe now for this exclusive interview full of explosive new details, only in PEOPLE!\n\nLeah Remini says attending the wedding of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes ended up not being a fairytale for the Kings of Queens actress.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nIn a revealing new interview, the actress spoke with 20/20 about her new tell-all book, Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology, in which she discusses her separation from Scientology.\n\nRemini, 45, said that the Church of Scientology invited her to Cruise\u2019s 2006 wedding in Italy, and she was asked to invite her friend Jennifer Lopez and Lopez\u2019s then-husband Marc Anthony. Remini claimed that during the three-day wedding, Church of Scientology officials attempted to separate her from Lopez.\n\n\u201cThey were trying to extract me,\u201d she said. \u201cI can only assume because they wanted to make Jennifer a Scientologist. Maybe I was barring that road for them.\u201d\n\nRemini said she also caused a stir at the wedding by repeatedly asking church officials why Scientology leader Miscavige\u2019s wife, Shelly, wasn\u2019t with him.\n\n\u201cShelly was always where David Miscavige was,\u201d Remini said. \u201cIt was a wedding of the century it was like, \u2018where s Shelly?'\u201d\n\nShelly\u2019s disappearance from public view has long caused controversy, though Scientology has repeatedly stated she isn\u2019t missing and the L.A.P.D. ruled a 2014 missing-persons report filed by Remini \u201cunfounded,\u201d saying officers had met with Shelly. In a statement provided to ABC, the Church of Scientology criticized what it termed Remini\u2019s \u201cbizarre efforts to harass the Church of Scientology\u2019s leader and his wife, whom Ms. Remini has been obsessed with for years.\u201d\n\nRemini says that upon returning home from the wedding, she was informed a number of wedding guests had filed reports with the church complaining about her behavior, saying she had been loud and rude.\n\nAccording to Remini, the reports claimed she had \u201cdisrupted the wedding\u201d and \u201cbasically destroyed the wedding.\u201d She said she felt she was being reprimanded for her \u201chorrible behavior.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Remini had written her own report to the church complaining about the wedding, saying Cruise and church head David Miscavige were damaging Scientology.\n\n\u201cBasically I was being asked to recant what I said, to apologize for ruining the wedding of the century,\u201d Remini told 20/20.\n\nThe church denied her claims, with a spokesperson telling ABC News, \u201cEvery claim Miss Remini has made is not only untrue but ridiculous and stupid.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: Former Scientologist Leah Remini Shows Support for Scientology Doc\n\nIn the 20/20interview, Remini said Holmes was one of the people who filed a report with the Church of Scientology criticizing Remini\u2019s wedding behavior.\n\nIn response to a request for comment from 20/20, Holmes issued the following statement, which was provided to PEOPLE by her publicist:\n\n\u201cI regret having upset Leah in the past, and wish her only the best in the future,\u201d Holmes said.\n\nShe did not comment to 20/20 about the alleged report against Remini.\n\nChurch International Spokesperson Karin Pouw previously told PEOPLE in a statement that Remini\u2019s claims are an effort to drum up attention for herself.\n\n\u201cIt comes as no surprise that someone as self-absorbed as Leah Remini with an insatiable craving for attention would exploit her former faith as a publicity stunt by rewriting her history with it, including omitting that she was participating in a program to remain a Scientologist by her own choice, as she was on the verge of being expelled for her ethical lapses,\u201d Pouw said.", "images":
