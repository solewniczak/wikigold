One of the first death hoaxes to spread online was the 2010 Morgan Freeman death hoax.On December 16th, 2010, Twitter user OriginalCJiZZle tweeted a message asserting that actor Morgan Freeman had died, prefaced by an RT (retweet) signature credited to CNN to make it appear as if the news organization had tweeted the original report:\n\n\"RT @CNN: Breaking News: actor Morgan Freeman has passed away in his Burbank home<< wow legendary actor #RIPmorganfreeman.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN quickly issued a response explaining that it had not reported on Freeman\u2019s death via Twitter :\n\n\"CNN did not report Morgan Freeman death. Rumor is false. CNN will aggressively investigate this hoax.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same day, CNN published an article titled \u201cWho said Morgan Freeman is dead?
