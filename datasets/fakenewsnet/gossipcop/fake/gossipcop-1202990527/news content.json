This is based on a true story. Patel is born in a poor Indian family, mother works as a laborer and his older brother works at odd jobs. He convinces his older brother that he can help lifting bales and they travel to a town where his brother leaves him to find work. His brother does not return and he gets on a train and gets locked in, the train has no passengers and after a couple of days ends up in Calcutta. He gets off the train but speaks a different language, and ends up sleeping with homeless children. He is befriended by a lady who brings in a male friend who doesn't have the his best interests at heart and he runs away. He tries to find articles to sell at the garbage dump and he is helped by a stranger where he eventually ends up at a home for lost children, it is very brutal there. A social worker assists him and he is adapted by an Australian couple, Nicole Kidman who is excellent in the role. 20 years later he has grown up and wants to work in the hospitality business. The couple also adapted another Indian boy who has severe mental difficulties. He meets and romances Rooney Mara. Patel tries to suppress his past but it reoccurs again as he hopes to find his mother and brother. He uses a google app and with it tries to find the location of his mother and brother. After many trials and tribulations he finds the location of his home and with the blessing of Kidman and her husband returns to India to find his mother. There is a very heartfelt and tearful reunion and he finds out that his brother was killed by a train shortly after his brother left him to find work. The movie won 6 academy award nominations including best picture. He finds out that his name was mispronounced and it means Lion.

An excellent moving film and highly recommended.", "images": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/gno/sprites/nav-sprite-global-1x-hm-dsk-reorg._CB405937547_.png",
