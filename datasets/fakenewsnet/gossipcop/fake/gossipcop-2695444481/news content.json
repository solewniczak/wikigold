She is known for her influence on the pop sound and style of the 2010s. Pursuing a career in gospel music at 16, Perry released her commercially unsuccessful debut album, Katy Hudson (2001), under Red Hill Records. She moved to Los Angeles at 17 to venture into secular music, adopting the stage name \"Katy Perry\" from her mother's maiden name. With producers Glen Ballard and Greg Wells, she recorded an unreleased album titled Fingerprints while signed to Java Records and then Columbia Records before being dropped. After this, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.[1]\n\nPerry rose to fame with her second album and major label debut, One of the Boys (2008), a pop rock record containing her debut single \"I Kissed a Girl\" and follow-up single \"Hot n Cold\", which respectively reached number one and three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The disco-influenced pop album Teenage Dream (2010) spawned five U.S. number one singles\u2014\"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\"\u2014becoming the first album by a solo female artist to do so. A reissue titled Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection (2012) subsequently had the U.S. number one single \"Part of Me\". Her fourth album Prism (2013) has themes of self-empowerment and relationships. With the music videos for its U.S. number one singles \"Roar\" and \"Dark Horse\", Perry became the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on YouTube. Witness (2017) featured an electropop sound with themes of liberation and a political subtext, while Smile (2020) featured themes of motherhood and self-help. She later embarked on her first concert residency titled Play in Resorts World Las Vegas, selling out multiple shows and receiving critical acclaim.\n\nPerry is one of the best-selling artists of all time, having sold over 143 million records worldwide. All of her studio albums released under Capitol have individually surpassed one billion streams on Spotify.[2] She has nine U.S. number one singles, three U.S. number one albums and has received various accolades, including four Guinness World Records, five Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award. Perry has been included in the annual Forbes lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011 to 2019. Her critically acclaimed Super Bowl halftime show performance is the most watched in history. Outside of music, she released an autobiographical documentary titled Katy Perry: Part of Me in 2012, and voiced Smurfette in The Smurfs film series. Perry began serving as a judge on American Idol, starting from its sixteenth season in 2018. She is also the most followed woman on Twitter, with over 100 million followers.\n\nLife and career\n\n1984\u20131998: Early life and family\n\nKatheryn Elizabeth Hudson was born on October 25, 1984, in Santa Barbara, California, to Pentecostal pastors Mary Christine (n\u00e9e Perry) and Maurice Keith Hudson.[4] Both of her parents turned to religion after a \"wild youth\".[5] Perry has English, German, Irish, and Portuguese ancestry.[6] Through her mother, she is a niece of film director Frank Perry.[7] She has a younger brother named David, who is a singer,[8] and an older sister, Angela.[9]\n\nFrom ages three to 11, Perry often moved across the country as her parents set up churches before settling again in Santa Barbara. Growing up, she attended religious schools and camps, including Paradise Valley Christian School in Arizona and Santa Barbara Christian School in California during her elementary years.[4][10] Her family struggled financially,[11] sometimes using food stamps and eating food from the food bank which also fed the congregation at Perry's parents' church.[12]\n\nGrowing up, Perry and her siblings were not allowed to eat the cereal Lucky Charms as the word \"luck\" reminded their mother of Lucifer, and had to call deviled eggs \"angeled eggs\".[13] Perry primarily listened to gospel music,[14] as secular music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends.[15] Perry later recalled a story about how a friend of hers played \"You Oughta Know\" by Alanis Morissette, which impacted her songwriting and singing.\n\nWhile not strictly identifying as religious, she has stated, \"I pray all the time \u2013 for self-control, for humility.\"[17] Wanting to be like her sister Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of their parents, who let her take vocal lessons as Angela was at the time. She began training at age nine,[18] and was incorporated into her parents' ministry,[5] singing in church from ages nine to 17.[19] At 13, Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday,[5][20] and publicly performed songs she wrote.[11] She tried to \"be a bit like the typical Californian girl\" while growing up, and started rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. Her brother David described her as a tomboy during her adolescence, which Perry talks about on her song \"One Of The Boys\".[21] She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug.[22]\n\n1999\u20132006: Career beginnings, Katy Hudson and Fingerprints\n\nPerry completed her General Educational Development (GED) requirements at age 15,[23] during her first year of high school,[24] and left Dos Pueblos High School to pursue a music career.[25] She briefly had music lessons in facilities rented from the Music Academy of the West.[26] Her singing caught the attention of rock artists Steve Thomas and Jennifer Knapp from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to improve her writing skills.[25] In Nashville, she started recording demos and learned how to write songs and play guitar.[14] Perry signed with Red Hill Records and recorded her debut album, a contemporary Christian record titled Katy Hudson, which was released on March 6, 2001. She also went on tour that year as part of Phil Joel's Strangely Normal Tour[27][28] and embarked on other performances of her own in the United States.[29] Katy Hudson received mixed reviews from critics and was commercially unsuccessful, selling an estimated 200 copies before the label ceased operations in December.[30][31] Transitioning from gospel music to secular music, Perry started working with producer Glen Ballard, and moved to Los Angeles at age 17.[33] She opted to work with Ballard due to his past work with Alanis Morissette, one of her major inspirations. In 2003, she briefly performed as Katheryn Perry to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson. She later adopted the stage name 'Katy Perry', using her mother's maiden name. In 2010, she recalled that \"Thinking of You\" was one of the first songs she wrote after moving to Los Angeles.[35]\n\nIn 2004, she signed to Ballard's label, Java Records, which was then affiliated with The Island Def Jam Music Group. Perry began work on a solo record due for release in March 2005, but the record was shelved after Java was dropped.[36] Ballard then introduced her to Tim Devine, an A&R executive at Columbia Records, and she was signed as a solo artist. By November 2006, Perry had finished writing and recording material for her Columbia debut titled Fingerprints (with some of the material from this time appearing on One of the Boys) which was planned for release in 2007.[37] Some of the material from Fingerprints that did not make it on One Of The Boys was given to other artists, such as \"I Do Not Hook Up\" and \"Long Shot\" to Kelly Clarkson and \"Rock God\" to Selena Gomez & the Scene.[38][39]\n\nPerry worked with songwriters including Desmond Child, Greg Wells, Butch Walker, Scott Cutler, Anne Preven, The Matrix, Kara DioGuardi, Max Martin, and Dr. Luke.[40][41] In addition, after Devine suggested that songwriting team The Matrix become a \"real group\", she recorded a shelved album called The Matrix with them.[42] The Matrix was planned to be released in 2004 but was cancelled due to creative differences. It was later released in 2009 after the release of One of the Boys. Perry was dropped from Columbia in 2006 as Fingerprints neared completion. After the label dropped her, she worked at an independent A&R company called Taxi Music.[43]\n\nPerry had minor success prior to her breakthrough. One of the songs she had recorded for her album with Ballard, \"Simple\", was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.[44] She provided backing vocals on Mick Jagger's song \"Old Habits Die Hard\",[45] which was included on the soundtrack to the 2004 film Alfie.[46] In September 2004, Blender named Perry \"The Next Big Thing\".[44] She recorded background vocals on P.O.D.'s single \"Goodbye for Now\", was featured at the end of its music video in 2006, and performed it with them on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.[47] That year, Perry also appeared in the music video for \"Learn to Fly\" by Carbon Leaf, and played the love interest of her then-boyfriend, Gym Class Heroes lead singer Travie McCoy, in the band's music video for \"Cupid's Chokehold\".[48]\n\n2007\u20132009: Breakthrough with One of the Boys\n\nAfter Columbia dropped Perry, Angelica Cob-Baehler, then a publicity executive at the label, brought Perry's demos to Virgin Records chairman Jason Flom. Flom was convinced that she could be a breakthrough star and she was signed to Capitol Records in April 2007. The label arranged for her to work with Dr. Luke to add an \"undeniable smash\" to her existing material.[49][50] Perry and Dr. Luke co-wrote the songs \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold\" for her second album One of the Boys. A campaign was started with the November 2007 release of the video to \"Ur So Gay\", a song aimed at introducing her to the music market.[51] A digital EP of the same name was also released that month.[52] Madonna helped publicize the song by praising it on the JohnJay & Rich radio show in April 2008,[53] stating \"Ur So Gay\" was her \"favorite song\" at the time.[54] In March 2008, Perry made a cameo appearance as a club singer in the Wildfire episode \"Life's Too Short\"[55] and appeared as herself during a photo shoot that June on The Young and the Restless for the show's magazine Restless Style.[56]\n\nPerry released her first single with Capitol, \"I Kissed a Girl\", on April 28, 2008,[57] as the lead single from One of the Boys. The first station to pick up the song was WRVW in Nashville, who were inundated with enthusiastic calls the first three days they played it.[58] The track reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100.[59] \"I Kissed a Girl\" created controversy among both religious and LGBT groups. The former criticized its homosexual theme, while the latter accused her of using bi-curiosity to sell records. In response to speculation that her parents opposed her music and career, Perry told MTV that they had no problems with her success.[60] One of the Boys, released on June 17, 2008, garnered mixed critical reviews and reached number nine on the US Billboard 200.[61][62] The album went on to sell 7 million copies worldwide.[63] \"Hot n Cold\" was released the following September[64] and became the album's second successful single, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100[65] while topping charts in Germany,[66] Canada,[67] the Netherlands[68] and Austria.[69] Later singles \"Thinking of You\" and \"Waking Up in Vegas\" were released in 2009[70][71] and reached the top 30 of the Hot 100.[65] The Matrix's self-titled debut album, which Perry had recorded with the band in 2004, was released onto iTunes on January 27, 2009, as a result of her solo success.[46][72]\n\nAfter finishing the 2008 Warped Tour,[73] Perry hosted the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2008, where she won the award for Best New Act.[74] At the 2009 Brit Awards, she also won the award for International Female Solo Artist.[75] Perry embarked on her first headlining world tour, the Hello Katy Tour, from January to November 2009 to support One of the Boys.[76] On August 4, 2009, she performed as opening act for one date of No Doubt's 2009 Summer Tour.[77] Perry also hosted the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2009, becoming the first person to host two consecutive ceremonies of the European awards.[78] On July 22, 2009, Perry recorded a live album titled MTV Unplugged, which featured acoustic performances of five tracks from One of the Boys as well as one new song, \"Brick by Brick\", and a cover of Fountains of Wayne's \"Hackensack\".[79] It was released on November 17, 2009.[80] Perry also appeared on two singles with other artists; she was featured on a remix of Colorado-based band 3OH!3's song \"Starstrukk\" in September 2009,[81] and on a duet with Timbaland entitled \"If We Ever Meet Again\", from his album Shock Value II, three months later.[82][83] The Guinness World Records recognized her in its 2010 edition as the \"Best Start on the U.S. Digital Chart by a Female Artist\", for digital single sales of over two million copies.[84]\n\nAfter Perry and Travie McCoy split up in December 2008,[85] they briefly reconciled before she ended their relationship in 2009.[86][87] Perry met her future husband Russell Brand in the summer of 2009 while filming a cameo appearance for his film Get Him to the Greek. Her scene, in which the two kiss, does not appear in the film.[88] She began dating Brand after meeting him again that September at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[89] The couple became engaged on December 31, 2009, while vacationing in Rajasthan, India.[90]\n\n2010\u20132012: Teenage Dream and first marriage\n\nAfter serving as a guest judge on American Idol,[91] Perry released \"California Gurls\" featuring Snoop Dogg on May 7, 2010.[92] The song was the lead single from her third studio album, Teenage Dream, and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in June.[93] She also served as a guest judge on British The X Factor later that month[94] before releasing the album's second single, \"Teenage Dream\", in July.[95] \"Teenage Dream\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in September.[96] Released on August 24, 2010,[97] Teenage Dream debuted at number one on the Billboard 200,[98] and received mixed reviews from music critics.[99] It has since sold 6 million copies worldwide.[100] Teenage Dream would go on to win the 2011 Juno Award for International Album of the Year.[101] In October, \"Firework\" was released as the album's third single.[102] It became the album's third consecutive number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on December 8, 2010.[103]\n\n\"E.T.\" featuring Kanye West was released as the fourth single from Teenage Dream on February 16, 2011.[104] It topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five non-consecutive weeks, making Teenage Dream the ninth album in history to produce four number one singles on the chart.[105] \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" followed as the fifth single in June,[106] and Perry became the first female artist to achieve five number-one Billboard Hot 100 songs from one album when the single topped that chart on August 17, and the second artist after Michael Jackson with his album Bad.[107] For this record, she received an honorary American Music Award in November 2011[108] and a 2013 Guinness World Record.[109] On September 7, she set a new record by becoming the first artist to spend 69 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Hot 100.[110] After \"The One That Got Away\" was released as the album's sixth single in October, Teenage Dream became the third album to spawn six top-five songs on the Billboard Hot 100 after Rhythm Nation 1814 by Janet Jackson and Faith by George Michael.[111][112] The song peaked at number three in the US[113] and number two in Canada.[67]\n\nOn January 5, 2012, Perry was named the sixth best-selling digital artist in the United States, with sales of 37.6 million units according to Nielsen SoundScan.[114] That month, she became the first artist to have four songs sell over 5 million digital units when \"E.T.\" reached that mark along with \"Firework\", \"California Gurls\", and \"Hot N Cold\".[115] On February 13, Capitol released the lead single from Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, \"Part of Me\", which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Perry's seventh single overall to top the chart.[116] Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection was released on March 23,[117] and serves as a reissue of Teenage Dream.[118] \"Wide Awake\" was released on May 22 as the re-release's second single,[119] peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100[113] and number one in Canada[67] and New Zealand.[120]\n\nKaty Perry: Part of Me, which grossed $32.7 million Perry attending the Sydney premiere for her 2012 documentary, which grossed $32.7 million\n\nPerry embarked on her second tour, the California Dreams Tour, in support of Teenage Dream[76] from February 2011 to January 2012.[121] The tour grossed $59.5 million globally[122] and won her the award for Best Live Act at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards.[123] On September 23, 2011, she performed on the opening day of the 2011 Rock in Rio festival along with Elton John and Rihanna.[124] In September 2010, Perry was scheduled to appear on the 41st-season premiere of Sesame Street. After her scene was uploaded to YouTube, viewers criticized Perry's exposed cleavage. Four days before the scheduled airing, Sesame Workshop announced that the segment would not air on television, but would still be available to watch online.[125] Perry subsequently mocked the controversy on Saturday Night Live, where she was a musical guest and wore an Elmo-themed shirt showing large amounts of cleavage during one skit.[126]\n\nIn December 2010, Perry played Moe Szyslak's girlfriend in the live-action segment from a Christmas episode of The Simpsons titled \"The Fight Before Christmas\".[127][128] In February 2011, she made a guest appearance on the How I Met Your Mother episode \"Oh Honey\", playing a woman known as Honey.[129] The role won her the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Guest Star in January 2012.[130] She made her film debut in the 3D family motion picture The Smurfs as Smurfette on July 29, 2011.

He also said her management prevented him from speaking about his time with the singer. However, Johnny Wujek, the creative director of said party defended Perry, saying that she \"would never do something like that\" and accused Kloss of having an \"ongoing obsession\" with her.[244] After initially refraining from responding to this, believing it would have detracted from the Me Too movement, Perry has also denied Kloss's claims.[245]\n\nFollowing the release of her single \"Never Worn White\" in March 2020, Perry revealed in the accompanying music video that she was expecting her first child with Bloom.[246] \"Daisies\", the lead single from her sixth album, was released on May 15, 2020.

She described it as \"larger than life\" and \"the kookiest, most camp show I've ever put together.\"[265] The show has received critical acclaim[266] with Melinda Sheckells of Billboard saying that \"[Play's] sold-out opening night is part fantasy, part hallucination and thoroughly camp.[267]\n\nIn September 2021, Variety paid tribute to and honored Perry on their \"Power of Women\" issue, where she discussed her career, motherhood, and philanthropy.[268] As a nominee, she attended the Variety 2021 \"Power of Women\" dinner.[269] On her 37th birthday the following month, Perry guest hosted The Ellen DeGeneres Show[270] and starred in a holiday advertisement for Gap Inc. which featured her singing \"All You Need Is Love\" by The Beatles.

All of the melody choices that I make are because of Pet Sounds.\"[275] The singer also holds the Beatles' album The Beatles in high esteem, and described these two albums as \"the only things I listened to for probably two years straight.\"[276]\n\nShe cites Alanis Morissette and her 1995 album Jagged Little Pill as a significant musical inspiration, stating in 2012: \"Jagged Little Pill was the most perfect female record ever made. There's a song for anyone on that record; I relate to all those songs. They're still so timeless.\" Additionally, Perry borrows influence from Flaming Red by Patty Griffin and 10 Cent Wings by Jonatha Brooke.[277] Perry's autobiographical documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me was largely influenced by Madonna: Truth or Dare.

I'll be like 'Did I just get lucky, or did I mass-manipulate the world into thinking that seven songs were worth a number-one position?' And then I go back into the studio and I start writing, and the true essential oil of who I am comes bubbling back up and reminds me that it's always been inside of me, that nobody can take this away no matter what comment anyone makes.\" \u2014Perry on her confidence as a songwriter[289]\n\nWhile Perry's music incorporates pop, rock, and disco, Katy Hudson contains gospel.

She told Marie Claire: \"I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable.\"[17] Actress and comedian Kristen Wiig commented that \"as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record.\"[276] According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, \"being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet.\"[297] In 2013, The New York Times labeled her \"the most potent pop star of the day \u2013 her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation\".[298] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent \"clich\u00e9s\".[299] Throughout her career, Perry has also co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Lesley Roy,[300] Kelly Clarkson,[301] Jessie James Decker,[302] Selena Gomez & the Scene,[303][304] Britney Spears,[305] Iggy Azalea, Rita Ora,[306] Nicki Minaj, and Ariana Grande.[307]\n\nVoice\n\nPerry possesses a contralto vocal range.[308][309] Her singing has received both praise and criticism.

They had ears that moved and a tongue that stuck out. They were such a conversation piece. That's what is so great about fashion. \u2026 It's a form of communication. You don't have to start a smoking habit to start talking to someone. You can just wear cool shoes. It's an icebreaker.\"[345]\n\nLegacy and influence\n\nSeveral media outlets such as Billboard and Glamour have referred to her as the \"Queen of Pop\", while Vogue has dubbed Perry the \"Queen of Camp\" and a \"pop icon.\"[346][347][339][344] Andrew Unterberger of Billboard described Teenage Dream \"one of the defining LPs from a new golden age in mega-pop\"[348] while Christopher Rosa of Glamour named her as an influence to the pop sound and style of the 2010s, adding that her singles are \"some of the most recognizable, iconic, and impactful hits in pop history.\"[349] Perry was named \"one of the last decade's most reliable and successful hitmakers\" by the Official Charts Company in 2022.[350]\n\nAdditionally, Perry was included in Glamour's \"104 Women Who Defined the [2010s] in Pop Culture\" list, saying: \"[Perry] did more than just break chart records.
