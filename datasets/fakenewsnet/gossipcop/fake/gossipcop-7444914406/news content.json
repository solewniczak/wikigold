But now a new report claims that even beyond Markle's alleged feud with Middleton, Meghan must cope with Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, both of whom are in meltdown mode over the situation. The royal feud, playing out behind the palace walls, is a shock compared to the happy image that the world sees, pointed out Yahoo.\n\n\"With the world lapping up everything to do with Prince Harry and his fianc\u00e9e Meghan, it may come as a surprise to some that not everyone in the royal family is happy to have her around.\"\n\nThe insider explained that Beatrice and Eugenie already have a reputation for being snobs. Their father, Prince Andrew, reportedly encouraged their snobbish behavior, even whining to the queen about the lack of attention given to his princess daughters.\n\nMeghan has become a convenient scapegoat. The two princesses even are reportedly complaining to their grandmother while aiming at Markle, according to the source.\n\n\"[Beatrice and Eugenie are] taking their frustrations out on Meghan.\"\n\n\"They were previously up in arms about Prince William marrying a commoner in Kate back in 2011, but apparently [that scenario] pales in comparison to Harry deciding to marry an American actress,\" added the palace insider.\n\n\"[The princesses are] snipping at their grandmother for letting the family go to the dogs by allowing [Prince Harry to wed Meghan Markle].\"\n\n\"It's a real shame. They're determined to make [Meghan Markle] feel ostracized and refuse to have anything to do with her.\"\n\nKate couldn't avoid the spotlight when it came to extending her views on Meghan's engagement to Prince Harry, and Middleton has followed proper protocol in congratulating Markle and Harry. But Eugenie and Beatrice reportedly have even avoided congratulating Meghan about her engagement.\n\n\"They are upset at...Meghan and Harry's nuptials tipped to be the wedding of the century.\"", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d7bb3a79-5556-4b77-95b6-1e7023672181.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/YkO9RX7cDoMm6hx5W74a.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/W4tCBPELsZJiig5WwEg6.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fa8aa86244d76bf2aee7e2fb5b934ea3?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fed4959c-fb17-4183-9a69-aa4c161aa162.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4705874/meghan-markle-finds-prince-harry-cant-stop-jealous-kate-middleton-princesses-royal-feud-rumor/", "title": "Meghan Markle Finds Prince Harry Can't Stop 'Jealous' Kate Middleton & Princesses Royal Feud [Rumor]", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meghan Markle Finds Prince Harry Can't Stop 'Jealous' Kate Middleton & Princesses Royal Feud [Rumor]", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4705874/meghan-markle-finds-prince-harry-cant-stop-jealous-kate-middleton-princesses-royal-feud-rumor/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Meghan Markle Finds Prince Harry Can't Stop 'Jealous' Kate Middleton & Princesses Royal Feud [Rumor]", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-12-29 12:11:15Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "Meghan Markle Finds Prince Harry Can't Stop 'Jealous' Kate Middleton & Princesses Royal Feud [Rumor]", "keywords": "Rumors", "news_keywords": "Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514549475.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
