Not only did Selena and Justin have a fight during their dinner date on Nov. 16 as confirmed by an eyewitness to HollywoodLife.com exclusively, but she allegedly denied him entrance to her home afterwards. Is this the end of Jelena?\n\nJustin Bieber and Selena Gomez dined at Yamato Japanese restaurant in Encino, California on Nov. 16. Unfortunately, Selena and Justin got into a fight on the dinner date before they were even served appetizers!\n\n\u201cThe \u2018couple\u2019 had an argument while inside the restaurant and Selena left less than 10 minutes into the meal. Justin quickly followed with his head bowed,\u201d a source inside the restaurant tells TMZ.\n\nAn eyewitness at Yamato restaurant tells HollywoodLife.com exclusively, \u201cAll of a sudden someone was yelling and I was like how embarrassing to have a fight in public. Then I realized it was Selena Gomez and she was having a fight with Justin Bieber. She was so mad she was crying and just stormed out of the restaurant. Justin followed behind her and looked upset. He looked kind of shocked like \u2018what just happened?\u2019 I felt really really sorry for them.\u201d\n\nJustin, 18, allegedly followed Selena, 20, home, but sadly, she denied him entrance into the gate of her home and he ended up driving off.\n\nJustin appeared to be crying outside of Selena\u2019s gate as het got out of his car.\n\nJustin waited outside Selena\u2019s gate for 30 minutes before leaving. In one of the photos, Selena is seen flipping Justin the bird!\n\nPerhaps this is why Justin tweeted this morning, Nov. 17, about how things aren\u2019t easy right now and he\u2019s \u201ctrying.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: Justin DID sleepover Selena\u2019s on Nov. 16. See the pic here!\n\nWhat do YOU think, HollywoodLifers? Is this the end of Jelena?\n\n\u2014 Chris Rogers\n\nFollow\n\n@ChrisRogers86\n\nSubscribe To Us On YouTube!\n\n\n\nMore Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez News:", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=4630073&action=edit", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-split_19.jpeg?w=600", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/taylor.jpg?w=300", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bella-Hadid-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/massage-gun-adobe-stock-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nicole-leans-rafe-days-of-our-lives-jj.jpg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/chrisrogers.jpg?w=48", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-practice-presentation.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-split_19.jpeg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/evan-rachel-wood-and-marilyn-manson-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brigitte-nielson-wraps-arm-around-husband-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AP21265583383493_1440x1080.jpg?w=230&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-split_19.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Rogers", "Thea Glassman", "Jason Pham", "Nikki Brown", "Amy Mistretta", "Richard Simms", "Deputy Editor Of Los Angeles"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2012/11/17/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-dating-restaurant-fight/", "title": "Selena Gomez & Justin Bieber Have Huge Fight After Dinner Date", "meta_data": {"description": "Selena is not happy with Justin!
