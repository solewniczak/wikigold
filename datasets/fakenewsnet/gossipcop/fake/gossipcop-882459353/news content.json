But the Hollywood action hero appears to have extinguished the tabloid firestorm with an agreement that one source said grants Holmes primary custody of their daughter, Suri, and control of her religious upbringing.\n\nThe confidential deal was hammered out over the weekend in New York and announced Monday, 11 days after Holmes took the industry and her husband by surprise with the filing of divorce papers in Manhattan. A key issue in the split was the Church of Scientology, of which Cruise is the most prominent member.\n\nWith a prenuptial agreement governing the distribution of assets, talks between lawyers for Cruise and Holmes, who was raised Roman Catholic, centered on the role of Scientology in the upbringing of 6-year-old Suri, according to the source who was familiar with the negotiations but not authorized to discuss them publicly. The agreement provides Cruise with visitation rights but gives Holmes the lead role in choosing how Suri will be educated, the source said Monday.\n\nPHOTOS: Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes through the years | Cruise's evolution as an actor | Shortest celebrity marriages\n\n\u201cShe is the primary caretaker right now and Tom is the one who primarily goes away on movies. So little will change,\u201d the source said.\n\nHolmes initiated divorce proceedings on June 28, reportedly identifying the parties as Anonymous versus Anonymous. Cruise had not yet responded in court when the parties began settlement discussions. The deal avoids a long court battle that could have become a public relations nightmare not only for the 50-year-old \u201cTop Gun\u201d veteran, who has several big-budget movies upcoming, but also for Scientology.\n\nTabloid coverage of the split has portrayed Cruise and Scientology negatively, with headlines such as \u201cKatie Holmes \u2018Felt Like She Was in Rosemary\u2019s Baby\u2019 \u201d and \u201cKatie Free at Last.\u201d While Cruise has remained silent beyond a brief statement saying he was \u201cdeeply saddened,\u201d Scientology has dispatched spokesmen to defend its practices.\n\nCruise and Holmes appeared to refer to the religious component of their split in a joint statement: \u201cWe want to keep matters affecting our family private and express our respect for each other\u2019s commitment to each of our respective beliefs and support each other\u2019s roles as parents,\u201d they said.\n\nHolmes had hired three law firms with experience handling high-profile breakups and she relied on her father, Martin, a Toledo, Ohio, attorney who lists family law among his specialties. Jonathan Wolfe, a New Jersey lawyer for Holmes, said Monday: \u201cThe case has been settled and the agreement has been signed. We are thrilled for Katie and her family and are excited to watch as she embarks on the next chapter of her life.\u201d\n\nCruise was represented by longtime legal counsel Bert Fields, and Dennis Wasser, who handled the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d star\u2019s divorce from Nicole Kidman. \u201cTom is really pleased we got there, and so am I,\u201d Fields said in a statement.\n\nHolmes and Cruise married in 2006. It was his third marriage and her first. Cruise\u2019s net worth far outstrips that of Holmes, who is 16 years his junior and best known for her role on the TV show \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek.\u201d (Forbes magazine estimated last week that Cruise earned $75 million in the 12 months ending in May.)\n\nThe couple signed a prenuptial agreement spelling out what Cruise would pay Holmes in the event of a divorce, according to the source familiar with divorce negotiations. \u201cKatie does not get any significant money or property,\u201d the source said.\n\nWhen Cruise and Kidman ended their marriage in 2001, they shared legal custody of their two children, Connor and Isabella. Cruise, however, became the primary caretaker, raising the children in Los Angeles while Kidman moved to Nashville, Tenn., and remarried.\n\nExperts said that no matter what the terms of the separation agreement, Cruise will still have a legal right to teach Suri Scientology when she is in his care. Authorities in so-called \u201cspiritual custody\u201d disputes said that while family law judges try to ensure that the interests of children of divorce are protected in matters like medical care and housing, they give both parents broad leeway in choosing a religious upbringing.\n\n\u201cThe general rule is the courts will defer unless the consequences are really detrimental to the health of the child \u2014 a threat of immediate and substantial harm,\u201d said Jeffrey Shulman, a professor of law at Georgetown University who has written extensively about the issue and believes that standard doesn\u2019t protect children sufficiently.\n\nIn the case of Cruise and Scientology, a judge could intervene if the religion was used to turn Suri away from Holmes because she was not an adherent, Shulman said. \u201cThe courts could say to Cruise, \u2018You cannot conduct yourself in a way that alienates the child from Katie Holmes.\u2019 But mere doctrine may not be enough for the court to do that.\u201d\n\nCourts won\u2019t rule on the merits of a particular religion, New York lawyer Malcolm Taub said. \u201cThey would not say that Scientology is not a valid religion so we\u2019re going to award (sole spiritual custody) to Katie Holmes,\u201d Taub said.\n\nSpeaking generally and not in particular regard to Scientology, Alton Abramowitz, a family law attorney in Manhattan, said, \u201cThere are ways of dealing with radical beliefs that still allows the parents to practice what they believe and expose the child to those beliefs.\u201d\n\nBut there are limits. Not that long ago, Abramowitz was involved in a case where a father\u2019s religion called for animal sacrifice. The mother objected, the lawyer said, with the court ruling \u201cthat no animal sacrifices will be performed in the child\u2019s presence.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n(Times staff writer Harriet
