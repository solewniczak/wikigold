(Snapchat just confirmed its acquisition of Bitmoji.)\n\nKerr\u2019s ring featured a round-cut center diamond, set between two tapered baguettes.\n\nThe 33-year-old Australian model and Spiegel, 26, were first spotted together in Los Angeles in June of last year. The pair met at a Louis Vuitton dinner in 2014, starting a friendship that eventually developed into more, she told E! News last year. They\u2019ve remained largely out of the spotlight, but most recently stepped out together for the State Dinner for Nordic leaders at the White House this May.\n\nWATCH: Learn Celebrity Jeweler Neil Lane\u2019s Rules for Engagement Ring Shopping\n\nKerr previously dished on the romance to The Edit in January, explaining of her love, \u201cHe acts like he\u2019s 50. He\u2019s not out partying. He goes to work in Venice [Beach]. He comes home. We don\u2019t go out.\u201d\n\nShe added that the pair are decidedly low key, and would rather \u201cbe at home and have dinner, go to bed early.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a really kind person and very genuine and very authentic and I really appreciate that about him,\u201d she gushed to E! News. \u201cAnd also he\u2019s very intelligent.\u201d\n\nThe former Victoria\u2019s Secret Angel was previously married to Orlando Bloom, with whom she shares son, Flynn, 5.
