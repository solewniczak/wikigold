We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why she thought her recent flings would make Blake come crawling back!\n\nThese days, Kendall Jenner has been living her best life. From her make out session with Anwar Hadid to her multiple dates with Ben Simmons, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s enjoying the singe life. However, we\u2019ve just learned the real reason behind her many romances. \u201cIt sucks for Kendall that Blake [Griffin] got traded because that started the break up between the two. The long distance was an issue. But, she liked him a lot, and she still wanted him to fight for her and make it work. So, she has been dating, but she thought that would make him jealous and come after her again. It instead had him move on, and now she sees he is dating others himself and she hates that,\u201d a source close to Kendall tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nOn June 9, Blake was spotted spending some quality time with a mystery blonde in Los Angeles. And as much as we\u2019d like to hope, for Kendall\u2019s sake, that she\u2019s just a friend, the two were photographed kissing! I guess the Kendall and Blake ship has sailed. Aw! \u201cShe thought he would fight for her, and they would be an item again. Everything kind of blew up in her face,\u201d the insider continued. Poor Kendall!\n\nHowever, before we start the pity party, it looks like Kendall isn\u2019t taking any time to sulk. The model was spotted shopping in Beverly Hills with Ben on June 10 less than a week after her hookup with Anwar. \u201cKendall helped Ben look in the men\u2019s department, and she stood with him at the register as he made his purchase,\u201d a source explained to E! News. Now, all we\u2019re wondering is, which guy will she settle down with?!", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kendall_blake-ftr.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=4630073&action=edit", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/taylor.jpg?w=300", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bella-Hadid-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/massage-gun-adobe-stock-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kendall_blake-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/goldie-hawn-kate-hudson-campaign.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ncte-con-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/thomas-struggle-spoilers-BB-HW.jpg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/evan-rachel-wood-and-marilyn-manson-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brigitte-nielson-wraps-arm-around-husband-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kendall_blake-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robyn Merrett", "Kristyn Burtt", "Jason Pham", "Jiji Ugboma", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/11/kendall-jenner-jealous-blake-griffin-moving-on-split/", "title": "Kendall Jenner \u2018Jealous\u2019 That Blake Griffin Has Moved On As She Keeps It Casual With Ben & Anwar", "meta_data": {"description": "Kendall Jenner is jealous that ex Blake Griffin is moving on.
