The way Jameela sees it, consider the source.\n\nThe Kardashian children, of course, have essentially always grown up in privilege, as their father Robert Kardashian was a high powered, high-earning lawyer (family matriarch Kris Jenner later married Olympic hero Bruce Jenner, who transitioned to Caitlyn Jenner in 2015). The Kardashian-Jenner children haven't exactly struggled to make end's meet, Jameela argues.\n\nRob Latour/Shutterstock\n\n\"I think if you grew up in Beverly Hills with super successful parents in what was simply a smaller mansion \u2026 Nobody needs to hear your thoughts on success/work ethic,\" Jameela tweeted in response to a Variety cover story on the reality TV family. \"This same 24 hours in the day s\u2014 is a nightmare. 99.9% of the world grew up with a VERY different 24 hours.\"\n\nIn the story, Kim who is the creator of the highly-successful KKW Beauty and Skims brands, was asked to give business advice. \"Get your f\u2014\u2014 a\u2013 up and work. It seems like nobody wants to work these days,\" she said.\n\nMatt Baron/Shutterstock\n\nThe Kardashian-Jenner family recently inked a reportedly nine-figure payday from Hulu, which Khloe Kardashian recently defended by arguing they give \"so much of [their] personal lives up for entertainment.\"\n\n\"The Good Place\" actress clearly isn't buying what the Kardashians are selling.\n\n\"They shouldn't be asked about their secret to success,\" \"The Misery Index\" host wrote. \"They shouldn't answer those questions. It's all obvious to everyone, and I hope nobody holds themselves to the standards of people who were raised by millionaires.\"\n\nLaurent Vu/SIPA/Shutterstock\n\nThe actress, though, did acknowledge that Kris and Co. are a \"super impressive family of businesswomen,\" noting that have \"a genius manager in their mother as well as their own hard work and personal sacrifices.\" However, she ripped them for creating an unrealistic beauty standards via technology.\n\n\"Dude if we just took away their photoshop they wouldn't have what they have\u2026.,\" she wrote. \"Photoshop when used as a tool to deceive women into buying products and feeling bad about themselves is the shameful act: not pointing it out. It's false advertising and has lead to literal psychological harm in women who follow them. I said what I said.\"\n\nIn a coup de grace, Jameela added of Kim, \"She came up from the mean streets of Beverly Hills with very successful parents/step parents\u2026 but in a *much* smaller mansion. A TRUE GRIND. An inspiration. A photoshop icon.\"\n\nShe came up from the mean streets of Beverly Hills with very successful parents/step parents\u2026 but in a *much* smaller mansion. A TRUE GRIND. An inspiration. A photoshop icon. \u2014 Jameela Jamil \ud83c\udf08 (@jameelajamil) March 9, 2022\n\nInterestingly enough, when the article first came out, it was Kourtney Kardashian who was on the receiving end of most ire, after agreeing with Kim's comments about \"nobody\" wanting to work. Kourt quickly responded, \"That's so true.\" After Kourt's agreement, fans were very, very quick to point out many of her comments about not wanting to work.\n\nKourtney once told Kim and Khloe, \"Like working, is just, it's not my top priority. It's never going to be.\" One viral Twitter comment noted, \"Kourtney goes on more vacations in a three month period than most ppl including myself go on in an entire lifetime.\"\n\nFurther, Kourt confirmed that she plans to quit reality TV (and seemingly no longer work) once the Hulu show ends.\n\n\"I see myself living in another city,\" she said. \"I don't think I see myself filming on a show in five years. I would probably envision myself, like, just living.\"", "images": ["https://www.wonderwall.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/whalerock-logo.svg",
