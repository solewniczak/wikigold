Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn\u2019t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nThe 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (\u201cLadies pick \u2014 finally it was my choice,\u201d jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.\n\n\u201cOn our first date, we just clicked,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was easy and that\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d\n\nStill, Bischoff admits it was \u201cnerve-wracking\u201d to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. \u201cI was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.\u201d\n\nBischoff hasn\u2019t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. \u201cI hope that he meets someone, if he hasn\u2019t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.\u201d\n\nNow, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she\u2019s moved on from her own reality show past. \u201cThat journey was a big part of my life,\u201d she says. \u201cBut since I\u2019ve met Ricky, I really haven\u2019t looked back.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F08%2Fwhitney-bischoff-600.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=600&h=300&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F08%2Fwhitney-bischoff-600.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=600&h=300&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F08%2Fwhitney-bischoff-600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aili Nahas", "Updated August"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-whitney-bischoff-talks-engagement-didnt-let-past-close-off-heart/", "title": "Bachelor Whitney Bischoff Talks Engagement: Didnt Let Past Close Off Heart", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Engagements,The Bachelor,Whitney Bischoff", "news_keywords": "Engagements,The Bachelor,Whitney Bischoff", "description": "The Bachelor winner got engaged to Ricky Angel last month", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Bachelor Whitney Bischoff Talks Engagement: Didnt Let Past Close Off Heart", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-whitney-bischoff-talks-engagement-didnt-let-past-close-off-heart/", "description": "The Bachelor winner got engaged to Ricky Angel last month", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=600&h=300&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F08%2Fwhitney-bischoff-600.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 300}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-whitney-bischoff-talks-engagement-didnt-let-past-close-off-heart/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F08%2Fwhitney-bischoff-600.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-whitney-bischoff-talks-engagement-didnt-let-past-close-off-heart/", "title": "Bachelor Whitney Bischoff Talks Engagement: Didnt Let Past Close Off Heart", "description": "The Bachelor winner got engaged to Ricky Angel last month", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=600&h=300&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F08%2Fwhitney-bischoff-600.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-whitney-bischoff-talks-engagement-didnt-let-past-close-off-heart/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
