However, it appears that the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is now taking a step back, especially when it comes to Khloe Kardashian's feud with the former Olympian.\n\nKhloe Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner used to have a really close relationship, especially when the former's dad passed away and the latter took over as the reality star's father figure.

When asked if the arrival of her baby will \"affect things\" with her former stepdad, Khloe Kardashian replied that things will remain as they were.\n\nAlthough Khloe Kardashian didn't exactly say that she will keep the child away from Caitlyn Jenner, a Hollywood Life source claimed that Kim Kardashian supported her sister's decision to not make the I Am Cait star a part of her child's life.\n\n\"Kim is standing behind her sister and she will always have her back,\" the insider revealed. \"Their family still feels slighted by Caitlyn about what she said about Kris in her book and they've really rallied around Kris.\"", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fed4959c-fb17-4183-9a69-aa4c161aa162.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/W4tCBPELsZJiig5WwEg6.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/YkO9RX7cDoMm6hx5W74a.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e5b4d9e36d0094d040e7937a58f64fbc?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d7bb3a79-5556-4b77-95b6-1e7023672181.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4779872/kim-kardashian-steers-clear-from-khloes-decision-to-not-reconcile-with-caitlyn-jenner-during-pregnancy/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Supporting Khloe's Decision Not To Involve Caitlyn In Her Child's Life Is Fake News [Debunked]", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian Supporting Khloe's Decision Not To Involve Caitlyn In Her Child's Life Is Fake News [Debunked]", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4779872/kim-kardashian-steers-clear-from-khloes-decision-to-not-reconcile-with-caitlyn-jenner-during-pregnancy/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Kim Kardashian Supporting Khloe's Decision Not To Involve Caitlyn In Her Child's Life Is Fake News [Debunked]", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-02-10 22:48:51Z", "section": "Fact Checking"}, "description": "Kim Kardashian Supporting Khloe's Decision Not To Involve Caitlyn In Her Child's Life Is Fake News [Debunked]", "keywords": "Fact Checking", "news_keywords": "Fact Checking", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518302931.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
