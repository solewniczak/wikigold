The rumor was started by Hollywood Life on Monday when it claimed The Voice judge had been shopping for a $500,000 diamond ring to have when he asks his lady love to marry him. As an insider told the website, one of Shelton's assistants had recently been shopping with a private jeweler in Beverly Hills. The source surmised that the timing indicates that Blake is planning to ask Gwen to marry him on Valentine's Day.\n\nHollywood Life's report added that Gwen Stefani can expect some \"serious bling\" from Blake Shelton when he finally does pick the right ring.\n\nGossip Cop squashed the rumor hours after the article was published. It had readers take into consideration that the tabloid also claimed Shelton and Stefani had already gotten engaged and even \"secretly married.\" The celebrity surveillance website revealed that they were informed by reliable sources a long time ago that no sources close to Blake or Gwen share details with Hollywood Life.\n\nGP corrected another fabricated story just days before about Blake and Gwen after Celebrity Insider reported that the couple is having a \"miracle baby.\" The report cited a made-up report from OK! magazine that alleged the pair were celebrating two big changes in their lives -- their new baby and just getting married at Stefani's Beverly Hills home in the backyard. It went on to report that Stefani conceived after several IVF treatments.\n\nBlake Shelton Shopping For Diamond Ring For Gwen Stefani, Proposing To Her On Valentine's Day? https://t.co/RkQrEFGJJK \u2014 Gossip Cop (@GossipCop) February 6, 2018\n\n\u2014 Gossip Cop (@GossipCop) February 6, 2018\n\nThe couple seems to be doing great with things just the way they are.
