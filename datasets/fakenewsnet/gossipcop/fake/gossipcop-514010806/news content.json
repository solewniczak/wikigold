The \u2018Keeping Up With the Kardashians\u2019 star IS battling morning sickness, but she has been both \u2018happy and excited\u2019 since becoming pregnant.\n\n\u201cKylie [Jenner] has been battling slight morning sickness during her first trimester,\u201d but don\u2019t worry because \u201cshe has been laughing her way to the bathroom in the morning, as she endures the entirely new experience. Kylie has been sleeping more now that she is pregnant and spending more time in bed, relaxing and dealing with her subtle body changes. Despite battling morning sickness, Kylie has been happy, excited and positively glowing since becoming pregnant. She wears it really well,\u201d a source close to Kylie tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nIsn\u2019t that amazing? We love hearing that Kylie, 20, is putting on a brave face despite battling morning sickness, because let\u2019s be real \u2014 sometimes pregnancy isn\u2019t pretty. And by that, we just mean that it can often be painful. So we\u2019re happy to hear Kylie is doing well. Plus, her baby daddy is also treating her like a queen (as he should be)! \u201cTravis [Scott] has been with her, pampering her with breakfast in bed during mornings when she is not feeling well, and whenever he is not touring. They are spending more morning time cuddling in bed together, talking about baby names and what great parents they are going to be,\u201d our source adds.\n\nAs was previously reported, Kylie Jenner is allegedly four months pregnant with her first baby. And she and Travis, who started dating in April 2017, seem like they\u2019re more than ready to welcome a beautiful baby boy or girl into the world in early 2018. We can\u2019t wait to see them as parents!\n\nHollywoodLifers, are YOU happy to hear Kylie\u2019s loving pregnancy?
