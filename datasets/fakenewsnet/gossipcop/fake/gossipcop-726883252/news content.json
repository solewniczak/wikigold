Like many couples, they struggled with a modern marriage.\u201d\n\nSeveral insiders have told PEOPLE that the ousted Today Show co-anchor was allegedly often unfaithful to Roque, whom he wed in 1998 after meeting on a blind date. (Lauer was previously married to television producer Nancy Alspaugh from 1981-88.)\n\nLauer and Roque share three children: son Jack, 16, daughter Romy, 14, and son Thijs, 11.\n\nHere, we look back on what the intensely private pair has said about their union.\n\nCelebrities Attend The Philadelphia 76ers Vs New York Knicks Game - January 18, 2016 From left: Jack Matthew Lauer, Romy Lauer, Thijs Lauer and Matt Lauer | Credit: James Devaney/GC Images\n\nNot love at first sight\n\nIn 1998, Lauer discussed meeting Roque on a blind date.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those slow-developing things,\u201d he told the Palm Beach Post. \u201cI don\u2019t think I kissed her for two months.\u201d\n\n\u2018She is terrific\u2019\n\nAlso in 1998, Lauer hinted about popping the question to Roque during an interview with Larry King, though he did not share her name.\n\n\u201cI am single, but extremely committed and spoken for,\u201d Lauer said, adding that his mystery woman was was \u201cnot in the media.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is terrific. It has been about eight months now,\u201d he added.\n\nAs for trying the knot, he said, \u201cThat was written someplace \u2014 that Matt\u2019s afraid of commitment. It\u2019s not at all true. I think it\u2019ll be something we\u2019ll look at each other and day and say boom \u2014 and it\u2019ll happen quickly. I really do.\u201d\n\nThey tied the knot in Bridgehampton, New York, later that year.\n\n2013 Tribeca Ball - Arrivals Matt Lauer (left) and Annette Roque | Credit: Jemal Countess/Getty Images\n\n\u2018Cruel and inhumane\u2019\n\nRoque briefly filed for divorce in 2006. In court documents obtained by the National Enquirer, Roque claimed Lauer committed \u201ccruel and inhumane\u201d acts against her, demonstrating \u201cextreme anger and hostility\u201d that endangered her mental and physical wellbeing as well as repeatedly criticized her parenting skills.\n\nDespite the allegations, Roque withdrew the court papers three weeks after filing them.\n\nRefuting rumors\n\n\u201cEvery once in a while I\u2019ll read quotes from so-called insiders, and it\u2019s never true,\u201d Lauer told PEOPLE in 2008 about the gossip surrounding the couple. \u201cWe grin and bear it, and the next thing you know, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn. Annette and I are great.\u201d\n\nApollo in the Hamptons 2017: Hosted by Ronald O.

(However, source have recently confirmed Roque and their kids lived full-time in the Hamptons while he stayed in the city on weekdays.)\n\n\u201c\u201cI am living in my apartment with Annette and my children as a family and a couple,\u201d Lauer said. \u201c\u201cI have never moved out. I am not moving out. There is no truth to that.\u201d\n\nRoque said in a separate interview with PEOPLE, \u201cOut of self respect, I want to stand up for our family and protect them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave we had a completely perfect, easy marriage? No. But the stories you\u2019ve read over the years are not true,\u201d Lauer said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re any different than any married couple that\u2019s been together for 12 years,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe accusations [of infidelity] are ridiculous and I\u2019m not going to [dignify] them with an answer. It\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nApologizing to \u2018the people I cherish dearly\u2019\n\nIn November, Lauer alluded to his wife and family in a statement after his termination from Today.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,\u201d Lauer said. \u201cTo the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.\n\n\u201cSome of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fmatt-lauer-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F11%2Fmatt-lauer.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1242&h=621&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fmatt-lauer-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fgettyimages-166113249-1-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1242&h=621&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fmatt-lauer-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michele Corriston", "December"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/matt-lauer-annette-roque-marriage-quotes/", "title": "Matt Lauer and Annette Roque's Strained Marriage: In Their Own Words", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Matt Lauer,News,Sexual Assault,Sexual Harassment,Today", "news_keywords": "Matt Lauer,News,Sexual Assault,Sexual Harassment,Today", "description": "NBC fired Matt Lauer for alleged inappropriate sexual behavior", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Matt Lauer and Annette Roque's Strained Marriage: In Their Own Words", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/matt-lauer-annette-roque-marriage-quotes/", "description": "NBC fired Matt Lauer for alleged inappropriate sexual behavior", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1242&h=621&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fmatt-lauer-1.jpg", "width": 1242, "height": 621}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/matt-lauer-annette-roque-marriage-quotes/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fmatt-lauer-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/matt-lauer-annette-roque-marriage-quotes/", "title": "Matt Lauer and Annette Roque's Strained Marriage: In Their Own Words", "description": "NBC fired Matt Lauer for alleged inappropriate sexual behavior", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1242&h=621&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fmatt-lauer-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/matt-lauer-annette-roque-marriage-quotes/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
