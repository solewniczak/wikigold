Doherty\u2019s opinion is nuanced and complex; she isn\u2019t simply pro- or anti-reboot. Based on her tweets, she\u2019s intrigued and curious about the new project, and doesn\u2019t want to be negative about it \u2014 she even defends the idea of a reboot in general \u2014 yet strongly agrees with some fans who object to the network\u2019s description of the project as \u201cfeminist reboot\u201d of the original series (when the 1998-2006 series was considered feminist too).\n\nShannen Doherty Stars In The New Series Charmed Credit: Getty Images\n\nFirst, on the very idea of a reboot:\n\nAnd notes that it will mean more lead roles for women\u2026\n\nLikewise, while some have slammed the idea of bringing back Charmed as unoriginal, The WB series actually followed 1996\u2019s similarly premised film The Craft and the 1995 book Practical Magic (which released a film version the same year Charmed hit the air). So at one point, the original Charmed was likewise considered by some to be a knock-off\u2026\n\nAnd Doherty would rather not be negative about it\u2026\n\nBUT \u2026 that official description though \u2026 (which described the new series this way: \u201cThis fierce, funny, feminist reboot of the original series centers on three sisters in a college town who discover they are witches. Between vanquishing supernatural demons, tearing down the patriarchy, and maintaining familial bonds, a witch\u2019s work is never done\u201d).\n\nAlso, the reboot\u2019s new cast better have different character names\u2026\n\nOh, and in case you\u2019re wondering what Doherty is watching lately:\n\nPreviously, co-star Holly Marie Combs had her turn to weigh in on the Charmed reboot.\n\nSpeaking of reboots, Doherty will next be seen in the Paramount Network\u2019s reboot of Heathers.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-51096419.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-51096419.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F11%2F11%2Fjames-hibberd-image.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-51096419.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Hibberd", "January", "At Pm Est"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/01/29/shannen-doherty-charmed-reboots/", "title": "Shannen Doherty on Charmed reboot's 'terrible, offensive' description", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Shannen Doherty,The CW", "news_keywords": "Shannen Doherty,The CW", "description": "Shannen Doherty has some candid thoughts about The CW's 'Charmed' reboot -- some supportive, some more critical", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Shannen Doherty on 'Charmed' reboot's 'terrible, offensive' description", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/01/29/shannen-doherty-charmed-reboots/", "description": "Shannen Doherty has some candid thoughts about The CW's 'Charmed' reboot -- some supportive, some more critical", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-51096419.jpg", "width": 1800, "height": 900}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/01/29/shannen-doherty-charmed-reboots/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-51096419.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/01/29/shannen-doherty-charmed-reboots/", "title": "Shannen Doherty on 'Charmed' reboot's 'terrible, offensive' description", "description": "Shannen Doherty has some candid thoughts about The CW's 'Charmed' reboot -- some supportive, some more critical", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-51096419.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/01/29/shannen-doherty-charmed-reboots/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517180400.0, "source": "http://ew.com", "summary": ""}
