As she was sitting front row at her father Kanye West\u2019s Adidas New York Fashion Week collection on Thursday, Feb. 12, 20-month-old North West was wearing a bulletproof vest from her dad\u2019s line.\n\nMom Kim Kardashian shared the look on Twitter on Monday, Feb. 16, writing, \u201cLook at my little cutie!!! #BabyYeezyBulletProofVest.\u201d\n\nThe image featured little Nori wearing the black vest, strapped on by velcro as she made a silly face.\n\nKimye\u2019s tiny tot has made several noteworthy Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week appearances, first throwing a fit at her dad\u2019s show while nestled in the front row between Vogue\u2019s Anna Wintour and Beyonce and Jay Z.\n\nShe then sat front row at the Alexander Wang show on Feb. 14, supporting her aunt Kendall Jenner, who walked in the show. Nori got upset and started crying when she spotted a photographer with a plush monkey toy around his camera lens, but later recovered when he let her play with the toy backstage.\n\nTell Us: What do you think of North\u2019s bulletproof vest?", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/north-west-wears-bulletproof-vest-kanye-wests-adidas-pics-2015172/", "title": "North West Wears Bulletproof Vest to Kanye West\u2019s Adidas Show: Pics", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kim Kardashian revealed on Twitter that North West wore a bulletproof vest designed by her father Kanye West at his Adidas show on Feb. 12 -- pics", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Yeezy Babywear: North Wears Bulletproof Vest to Kanye West's Adidas Show", "description": "Kim Kardashian revealed on Twitter that North West wore a bulletproof vest designed by her father Kanye West at his Adidas show on Feb. 12 -- pics", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/north-west-wears-bulletproof-vest-kanye-wests-adidas-pics-2015172/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-12-07T06:35:22+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2015-02-17T14:45:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-07T06:35:22+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Yeezy Babywear: North Wears Bulletproof Vest to Kanye West's Adidas Show", "description": "Kim Kardashian revealed on Twitter that North West wore a bulletproof vest designed by her father Kanye West at his Adidas show on Feb. 12 -- pics", "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 5.9.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1424184300.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
