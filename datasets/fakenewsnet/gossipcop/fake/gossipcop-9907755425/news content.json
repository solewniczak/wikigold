The Weeknd and Selena Gomez may be getting married soon, as HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned he\u2019s planning an epic proposal.\n\n\u201cAfter just a few weeks of dating, The Weeknd already knew that he and Selena [Gomez] had something super special. Abel\u2019s been in love before, and he\u2019s been in lust on a whole bunch of occasions \u2014 but his feelings for Selena are in a whole other league. Even though he knew it sounded crazy, the day after his first date with Selena, Abel vowed to [his best friend Lamar Taylor] that he had met the girl he was going to marry. And, the more he\u2019s gotten to know Selena, the more sure of that he becomes,\u201d a source close to The Weeknd tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. OMG! Isn\u2019t that just the sweetest thing you\u2019ve ever heard?! We\u2019re dying. Click here to see more cute pics of Selena and The Weeknd!\n\nBut even though the idea of The Weeknd and Selena Gomez getting married is the cutest thing ever, \u201cAbel doesn\u2019t want to rush things. He wants to plan a proposal that\u2019s going to blow Selena\u2019s mind. The past few months have been kind of stressful with Selena\u2019s [kidney transplant] operation and all. But now that the worst is over, and she\u2019s well on the road to a full recovery, Abel can focus on finishing off the last leg of his tour, and then concentrate on the how, when and where to propose,\u201d our source continues.\n\nThe Weeknd only has several more weeks left with his tour \u2014 he\u2019ll wrap it all up on December 14, 2017 \u2014 so Selena better get ready for an epic proposal, either in late 2017 or early 2018. Who knows \u2014 maybe The Weeknd will propose on New Year\u2019s Eve! Wouldn\u2019t that be great? Ahhh!
