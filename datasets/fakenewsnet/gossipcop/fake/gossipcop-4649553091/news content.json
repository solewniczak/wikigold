Since he was fired from Today, Bush has not had a job, and allegedly took a killing on his New York City townhouse he bought when he thought he'd be moving to New York for Today.\n\nDWTS has been the place that stars go to either take a victory lap, or say they are sorry through dance, says the Inquisitr. Billy Bush left Today with many of his co-workers angry with him, after a video was released of him palling around with Donald Trump, talking about grabbing women against their will, and what you can do when you are entitled. Just after his exit, DWTS was showing interest in Bush, but at the time, his agent brushed them off, perhaps assuming that other offers would come rolling in, but they haven't.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/75bc5f8f-bdb6-4450-8b34-19f657ce2327.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/5a8d67e0-f95c-458e-a699-7044c2610778.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/2236d9db-e4d3-4354-b26e-38352fa5255d.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/925dbac2ae40745f9073b6b5bc8d58a5?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6d24737c-2349-49d8-a143-a2972008e154.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/182b9846-2813-40a1-8902-1c8cb21bff1c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/5f552c8e-1a98-494f-840e-7bfe35030551.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/3967677/is-today-billy-bush-begging-to-be-on-dwts-even-willing-to-take-pay-cut/", "title": "Is Billy Bush Begging To Be On 'DWTS 2017?'
