So is she going to walk down the aisle as a pregnant pride?! Get all of the crazy details right here.\n\nSelena Gomez, 24, is pregnant with The Weeknd\u2018s baby, sources claim to Life & Style magazine in their Feb. 13 issue. OMG! \u201cSelena is crazy about The Weeknd, 24, and has told pals that he\u2019s the one,\u201d one insider tells the mag, adding that the \u201cHeart Wants What It Wants\u201d singer has been experiencing cravings. \u201cShe\u2019s [dropped] several hints that she\u2019s expecting, complaining to those close to her that she\u2019s too tired to stay out and that she feels nauseous. When she\u2019s not nauseous, though, she\u2019s having weird cravings, and she can\u2019t stop eating ice cream!\u201d That certainly does seem a little fishy.\n\nIt sounds kind of nuts, but friends say that Selena \u201ccan\u2019t wait to have a child of her own\u201d, according to the report, and she\u2019s constantly telling friends \u201chow much she wants to be a mom\u201d. Selena also isn\u2019t concerned about having kids at a relatively young age, as insiders claim to the mag: \u201cHer own mom [Mandy Teefey] had her at 16, and Selena thinks her mom did a great job, so being a young mom has never been an issue.\u201d\n\nThis is a lot to take in, and of course we\u2019re wondering if Selena is nervous about these dramatic changes in her life. Well, yes and no! \u201cShe is excited,\u201d a source shares with Life & Style. \u201cShe has always talked about having a little girl.\u201d\n\nFinally, if Selena and The Weeknd do get married, one thing\u2019s for sure: it\u2019ll be spectacular. \u201cAs far as weddings go, Selena wants to do something dramatic and different,\u201d an insider reveals to the mag. \u201cShe has talked to friends about everything from an African safari wedding to a tropical Mexican wedding.\u201d Sounds amazing!\n\nHollywoodLife.com has reached out for comment.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think it\u2019s too soon for Selena and The Weeknd to get married and start a family together?", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=4630073&action=edit", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/taylor.jpg?w=300", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bella-Hadid-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-pregnant-ftr.jpg?w=600", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/massage-gun-adobe-stock-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/goldie-hawn-kate-hudson-campaign.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-pregnant-ftr.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ncte-con-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/thomas-struggle-spoilers-BB-HW.jpg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/evan-rachel-wood-and-marilyn-manson-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brigitte-nielson-wraps-arm-around-husband-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-pregnant-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gabriella Ginsberg", "Kristyn Burtt", "Jason Pham", "Jiji Ugboma", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason", "Music Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/02/01/selena-gomez-pregnant-the-weeknd-marriage-baby/", "title": "Selena Gomez Pregnant With The Weeknd\u2019s Baby & Racing to Marry? \u2014 Report", "meta_data": {"description": "Selena Gomez and The Weeknd are moving fast, and a shocking Jan. 31 report claims that the couple is not only ready for marriage, but that Selena is EXPECTING!
