Read her extremely controversial remarks here!\n\nWell, these comments are going to make for an awkward situation during the next extended family get-together. Caitlyn Jenner, 68, all but called her daughters Kendall Jenner, 22, and Kylie Jenner, 20, a burden all while essentially disowning the rest of the Kardashians. In a recent interview with Piers Morgan, 52, on the show Life Stories, Caitlyn said, \u201cI don\u2019t talk to the Kardashians anymore. The only ones I am concerned about are Kendall and Kylie. They are my biological kids. I spent 23 years carting them around.\u201d Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did Caitlyn just summarize her role as a parent as hauling around Kylie and Kendall for over two decades? That\u2019s a little\u2026 harsh.\n\nWe reported earlier how Caitlyn also told Piers that she didn\u2019t trust the Kardashians, especially when it came to keeping her gender reassignment surgery a secret. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s none of their businesses. I had already been living as Caitlyn for a year and a half, OK? I didn\u2019t want them to leak it to the press, OK? There was no reason for them to know about it, of course I didn\u2019t trust them.\u201d Apparently, this was the justification for her leaving the last few pages that detailed her gender reassignment surgery out of her autobiography The Secrets of My Life in a draft she sent to the Kardashians.\n\nIn less contentious news, Caitlyn\u2019s dog Bertha who had gone missing after the roof of Caitlyn\u2019s home had been ripped off during the severe winds that struck Southern California in December was triumphantly found the very next day.
