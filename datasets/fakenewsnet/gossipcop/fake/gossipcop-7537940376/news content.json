We are and will always be united in our support of each other and our family.\u201d\n\nFergie and Josh share four-year-old son Axl.\n\nThe stars tied the knot back in 2009 in a Catholic ceremony after becoming engaged in 2007. They first met on the set of Josh\u2019s TV show Las Vegas in 2004, when Fergie\u2019s band the Black Eyed Peas made a cameo on the series.\n\nThe news is likely to come as a shock to fans of the pair - Transformers star Josh frequently gushed about his marriage to Fergie, including in a Haute Living magazine interview in May.\n\n\u201cWe genuinely like each other,\u201d the 44-year-old told the publication when quizzed on the secret to his happy union with the M.I.L.F. $ hitmaker.\n\n\u201c(We) have a lot of love for our son and have a good time together,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\nJust a month later, in June, Josh praised Fergie\u2019s parenting skills during an interview on America\u2019s The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\n\n\u201cHaving a kid at 40 years old is much different than having one at 22, you know, so I\u2019m a little more mature than I was then,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI\u2019m just doing the best that I can, trying not to screw him up for life. You never know. (But Fergie) is definitely more evolved than I am, and more patient.\u201d", "images": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-ig.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/newsletters/logo/newsletter-envelope.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-tblr.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-yt.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/share-modal-icon-close.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-circle-email.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-pin.svg", "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297991147858_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=520x", "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297991147858_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=90&size=520x&strip=all&w=288&h=216", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-li.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-circle-share.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-rdit.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-tw.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-fb.svg"], "top_img": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297991147858_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=520x", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://torontosun.com/2017/09/14/fergie-and-josh-duhamel-split", "title": "Fergie and Josh Duhamel split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "description": "Singer FERGIE has separated from her actor husband Josh Duhamel after eight years of marriage.", "google-site-verification": "kK9JgWClNj_xPmY-xEXJ8C95PgC_s3Ax12Qq6Wkqh88", "vf": {"container_id": "7cbbe99a-43f2-4e2b-9a0f-2eb9fae5af7c"}, "fb": {"pages": 189526659635, "app_id": 144435319507370}, "og": {"site_name": "torontosun", "type": "article", "title": "Fergie and Josh Duhamel split", "image": {"identifier": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297991147858_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=520x", "width": 520, "height": 327}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/torontosun/"}, "twitter": {"title": "Fergie and Josh Duhamel split", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297991147858_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=520x", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://torontosun.com/2017/09/14/fergie-and-josh-duhamel-split?ia_markup=1"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/O65lOrSQzug"], "publish_date": 1505340000.0, "source": "http://torontosun.com", "summary": ""}
