The Canadian is up for eight awards, including album of the year.\n\nRead more about:", "images": ["http://www.thestar.com/assets/svg/logo-toronto.svg", "http://www.thestar.com/assets/svg/google-play.svg", "http://www.thestar.com/assets/svg/logo-round-thestar.svg", "http://www.thestar.com/assets/svg/logo-thestar.svg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005674&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://www.thestar.com/assets/svg/brandmark-thestar.svg", "https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=nuz9l&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://images.thestar.com/HsK43mkpFoENjkrgk4XYCaL3Ph4=/1200x798/smart/filters:cb(2700061000)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/gta/2017/02/10/drake-says-hes-victim-of-fake-media-story-saying-he-asked-woman-to-remove-hijab/ci-drake10.jpg", "http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=nuz9l&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "http://www.thestar.com/assets/svg/app-store.svg"], "top_img": "https://images.thestar.com/HsK43mkpFoENjkrgk4XYCaL3Ph4=/1200x798/smart/filters:cb(2700061000)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/gta/2017/02/10/drake-says-hes-victim-of-fake-media-story-saying-he-asked-woman-to-remove-hijab/ci-drake10.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Star Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/02/10/drake-says-hes-victim-of-fake-media-story-saying-he-asked-woman-to-remove-hijab.html", "title": "Drake says he\u2019s victim of \u2018fake media story\u2019 saying he asked woman to remove hijab", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicon-thestar-144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicon-thestar-70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicon-thestar-150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicon-thestar-310.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "thestar.com", "application-name": "thestar.com", "fb": {"pages": 134392236659479}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/torontostar", "published_time": "2017-02-10", "modified_time": "2017-02-11T04:14:57.633Z", "section": "GTA", "tag": "News"}, "storyuuid": "6be43707-54a6-4416-806c-9e150f62f5d0", "description": "Rapper posted on Instagram that he was talking to four women, one of whom was wearing a winter scarf, and he told her to take it off.", "keywords": "entertainment news,Drake", "news_keywords": "entertainment news,Drake", "og": {"title": "Drake says he\u2019s victim of \u2018fake media story\u2019 saying he asked woman to remove hijab", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/02/10/drake-says-hes-victim-of-fake-media-story-saying-he-asked-woman-to-remove-hijab.html", "description": "Rapper posted on Instagram that he was talking to four women, one of whom was wearing a winter scarf, and he told her to take it off.", "site_name": "thestar.com", "image": "https://images.thestar.com/HsK43mkpFoENjkrgk4XYCaL3Ph4=/1200x798/smart/filters:cb(2700061000)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/gta/2017/02/10/drake-says-hes-victim-of-fake-media-story-saying-he-asked-woman-to-remove-hijab/ci-drake10.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "thestar.com", "site": "@TorontoStar", "title": "Drake says he\u2019s victim of \u2018fake media story\u2019 saying he asked woman to remove hijab", "description": "Rapper posted on Instagram that he was talking to four women, one of whom was wearing a winter scarf, and he told her to take it off.", "image": "https://images.thestar.com/HsK43mkpFoENjkrgk4XYCaL3Ph4=/1200x798/smart/filters:cb(2700061000)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/gta/2017/02/10/drake-says-hes-victim-of-fake-media-story-saying-he-asked-woman-to-remove-hijab/ci-drake10.jpg"}, "parsely-title": "Drake says he\u2019s victim of \u2018fake media story\u2019 saying he asked woman to remove hijab", "parsely-link": "https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/02/10/drake-says-hes-victim-of-fake-media-story-saying-he-asked-woman-to-remove-hijab.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://images.thestar.com/HsK43mkpFoENjkrgk4XYCaL3Ph4=/1200x798/smart/filters:cb(2700061000)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/gta/2017/02/10/drake-says-hes-victim-of-fake-media-story-saying-he-asked-woman-to-remove-hijab/ci-drake10.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-02-11T01:41:57.000Z", "parsely-section": "news|gta", "parsely-tags": "entertainment news, Drake, word count: <350 words, inHouseArticle: false, tlc_news", "parsely-metadata": "{\"storyuuid\": \"6be43707-54a6-4416-806c-9e150f62f5d0\"}", "parsely-network-canonical": "https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/02/10/drake-says-hes-victim-of-fake-media-story-saying-he-asked-woman-to-remove-hijab.html", "vf": {"unique_id": "6be43707-54a6-4416-806c-9e150f62f5d0"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1486681200.0, "source": "http://www.thestar.com", "summary": ""}
