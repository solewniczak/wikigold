We\u2019ve got details on whether Selena Gomez would get in touch with Justin Bieber if things fall apart with fianc\u00e9e Hailey Baldwin.\n\nJustin Bieber officially put an end to the chance of a reconciliation with Selena Gomez by getting engaged to Hailey Baldwin, 21. While the 26-year-old singer is out there living her best life as a single lady, she still gets Bieber on the brain from time to time. \u201cSelena\u2019s happy and very busy with her life, but there are moments she still misses Justin. This is someone she has loved for so long, of course there are lingering feelings. But she is not going to reach out to him or try to interfere with his relationship while he is still with Hailey. But if things fell apart, she would be the first to send him a text. She will always have a place in her heart for her first love,\u201d a source close to the \u201cWolves\u201d singer tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cSelena has very mixed emotions when it comes to Justin being engaged. Some days she\u2019s almost relieved because it\u2019s shut the door and allowed her to move on. But other days she can\u2019t help but feel some disappointment. Selena\u2019s still coming to terms with her and Justin being over forever, so there are days she still can\u2019t quite believe he\u2019s engaged and about to marry someone else. For years Selena believed it would be her marrying Justin,\u201d our insider adds.\n\nFans seemed to think the same thing, speculating that Justin already had the engagement ring that he gave to Hailey picked out and made for Selena instead. The Biebs and the blonde model had such a whirlwind romance that led to him popping the question on July 7. They only had started dating a month before that, rekindling a romance that he ended in 2016 because he didn\u2019t want to be tied down to one woman.\n\nOut of nowhere he popped the question in the Bahamas, placing a custom-made oval diamond on Hailey\u2019s finger. It was so sudden, and came just four months after the Biebs and Selena had called it quits yet again in March of 2018. But Justin, 24, has truly seemed happy and at peace with the decision to make Hailey his wife. The man knows what he wants! He even feels so at ease with Hailey that he can let out his emotions, openly crying in front of her on Aug. 8 while she comforted her man. Now that\u2019s true love.", "images": ["https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/leonardo-dicaprio-gisele-bundchen-salma-hayek-ed-norton.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/taylor.jpg?w=300", "https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/thomas-struggle-spoilers-BB-HW.jpg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/selena-misses-justin-ftr.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=4630073&action=edit", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Kristin-Cavallari-Chase-Rice-ss-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kim-Kardashian-41-Is-The-Ultimate-Beach-Babe-FTR-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/beth_shiliday.jpg?w=48", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/emily-ratajkowski-cosrx-snail-mucin-essence.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/selena-misses-justin-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ncte-con-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/massage-gun-adobe-stock-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/selena-misses-justin-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Louisa Ballhaus", "Katie Decker-Jacoby", "Jiji Ugboma", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason", "Senior Evening Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/08/09/selena-gomez-misses-justin-bieber-first-love-engaged-hailey-baldwin/", "title": "Selena Gomez \u2018Still Misses\u2019 \u2018First Love\u2019 Justin Bieber \u2014 Would She Text Him If He Split With Hailey?", "meta_data": {"description": "Selena Gomez still misses Justin Bieber despite him being engaged to Hailey Baldwin.
