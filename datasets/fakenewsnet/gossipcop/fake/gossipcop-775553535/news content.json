His father, Vernon Lindsay Vaughn, worked as a salesman for a toy company.[5] As a child, he was raised both Protestant and Catholic by his Catholic mother and Protestant father.[6][7] He has Lebanese, Italian, Irish, English, and German ancestry.[8]\n\nVaughn grew up in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, where he played football and baseball and wrestled, although he has called himself \"unathletic\" and \"very average\" at high school sports.[9] He then moved to Lake Forest, where he graduated from Lake Forest High School in 1988. He was introduced to musical theater at a young age and decided to become an actor in 1987. He has credited his mother as the inspiration behind his career, saying that \"I saw her overcome stuff, and I thought if you worked hard at something you'd give yourself a chance\".[10]\n\nCareer\n\nVaughn in 2006\n\nIn 1988, Vaughn was cast in a Chevrolet television commercial and subsequently moved to Hollywood.

Two years later, he was cast in a lead role in a proposed revival of 77 Sunset Strip that was to air on the fledgling WB Television Network, but the project ceased development after initial testing. Vaughn did not receive wider success until his role in 1996's Swingers with Jon Favreau. Swingers was released in July 1996 and became a successful independent film. Vince's father Vernon also did a cameo in this film.\n\nAfterwards, director Steven Spielberg cast Vaughn in the blockbuster The Lost World: Jurassic Park which gave him increased exposure.

After this series of roles, Vaughn was dubbed one of the Hollywood \"Frat Pack\", a group of actors who frequently co-star in film comedies.
