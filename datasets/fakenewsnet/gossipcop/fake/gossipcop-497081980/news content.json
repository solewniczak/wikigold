Shadows of hard rock band Avenged Sevenfold talks about \u2018The Stage\u2019 and its first ever Grammy nomination\n\nNonbelievers may guffaw, but perhaps Avenged Sevenfold wasn\u2019t fated to possess a Grammy until the Huntington Beach band issued its seventh album \u2014 therefore avenging past oversights.\n\nThe hard-rock quintet, which was birthed in 1999, has been grinding riffs and gathering fans through albums including \u201cSounding the Seventh Trumpet,\u201d \u201cCity of Evil,\u201d \u201cNightmare\u201d and \u201cHail to the King.\u201d But only with its 2016 album \u201cThe Stage\u201d did the band draw the attention of Recording Academy voters.\n\nMaybe it was the album\u2019s conceptual underpinnings, which address current-day issues involving progress, religion, technology and the very question of life itself. Or maybe it\u2019s an acknowledgement that Avenged Sevenfold, nearly two decades into its career, is just hitting its stride.\n\nThe band is nominated in the rock song category for the title track from \u201cThe Stage.\u201d\n\nSinger and Avenged Sevenfold co-founder Matt Sanders, who performs as M. Shadows, spoke to The Times after he learned of the Grammy nod. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIt was surprising to learn that Avenged Sevenfold had never earned a nomination. Congratulations.\n\nYeah, you know, every year the nominations have come out, and we\u2019ve had some pretty big records, and every year we\u2019ve never gotten anything. So we kind of wrote it off as, \u2018We\u2019re probably never going to get one, and that\u2019s the way it is.\u2019 So it was a nice surprise.\n\n\u201cThe Stage\u201d is a concept album. Can you talk about its underlying story?\n\nI call it a \u201cconceptual album\u201d because there\u2019s not really a story there like Queensryche\u2019s \u201cOperation: Mindcrime\u201d or the Who\u2019s \u201cTommy.\u201d The record really goes to the human experience \u2014 one foot based in scientific things that we\u2019re dealing with now, like artificial intelligence and space exploration and where we\u2019re going as a human race \u2014 some of the big questions that are going to have to be answered. On the last track we had Neil deGrasse Tyson do a monologue that he\u2019d written for it.\n\nHow did you introduce \u201cThe Stage\u201d to your fans?\n\nWe were getting extremely bored with the bread-crumb release strategy \u2014 put out one song, then two songs. The way streaming is now, once the record comes out people have been listening to four or five songs and the whole record\u2019s out there and there are opinions out there. And when you\u2019re dealing with a conceptual record like this, we really wanted people to hear the whole thing.\n\nSo one day we dropped the video for \u201cThe Stage,\u201d which is the song that\u2019s nominated, and then two weeks later, just out of the blue, we played a show on top of Capitol Records and the record came out.\n\nBut it was a tough sell for the rock fans. They didn\u2019t really know what to think of it, and we don\u2019t really have the social media presence of a Beyonce, with 90 million followers. But the tour did extremely well and now we\u2019ve got a Grammy nod for it. So you take the good with the bad. We\u2019re really happy about it \u2014 today.\n\nDoes the nomination feel like a validation?\n\nIt\u2019s coming at a good time for us. I think when we were younger, all these things were, like \u2014 we don\u2019t care about the awards, we were just kind of out there.\n\nAnd I think some perspective on our career and perspective on how these things work, we\u2019re just really grateful at this point in our lives to be able to get the nod and show up. and it\u2019s rock song, so it\u2019s a televised award and we\u2019re really grateful for that.\n\nAnd to be in there with Foo Fighters and Metallica and all those bands, we\u2019re just excited. We\u2019re going against some Goliaths, but it\u2019s not about the win. We\u2019re just really happy to be recognized.", "images": ["https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/445b707/2147483647/strip/true/crop/662x348+0+338/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2F18%2Fdaaf04bfc8875208ed57ad154127%2Fla-lb-media-grammy-ill-20171128-075840", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/445b707/2147483647/strip/true/crop/662x348+0+338/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2F18%2Fdaaf04bfc8875208ed57ad154127%2Fla-lb-media-grammy-ill-20171128-075840", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-grammys-2018-nominations-live-updates-htmlstory.html", "title": "Grammy nominations 2018 updates: The Grammys embrace hip-hop and newcomers; Nashville, Post Malone, Ed Sheeran snubbed", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Grammy nominations 2018 updates: The Grammys embrace hip-hop and newcomers; Nashville, Post Malone, Ed Sheeran snubbed", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-grammys-2018-nominations-live-updates-htmlstory.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/445b707/2147483647/strip/true/crop/662x348+0+338/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2F18%2Fdaaf04bfc8875208ed57ad154127%2Fla-lb-media-grammy-ill-20171128-075840", "url": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/445b707/2147483647/strip/true/crop/662x348+0+338/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2F18%2Fdaaf04bfc8875208ed57ad154127%2Fla-lb-media-grammy-ill-20171128-075840", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "description": "In a reflection of the current state of pop, in which hip-hop and urban music are the dominating forces, artists such as Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, Childish Gambino and Bruno Mars are among the top nominees the 60th Grammy Awards, to be held Jan. 28 from Madison Square Garden in New York.
