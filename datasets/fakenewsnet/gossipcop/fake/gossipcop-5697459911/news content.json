In the last few months, we\u2019ve heard rumors that Oprah Winfrey, Kanye West, Duane \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, and Katy Perry are going to run \u2014 and that\u2019s just naming a few. There\u2019s also George Clooney, whose recent donation has some people wondering: George Clooney for president?\n\nThe topic was first broached back in the beginning of September 2017, when Clooney was doing press for his movie Suburbicon. A reporter asked if he\u2019d like to run for president one day, and Clooney said,\n\n\"Would I like to be the next president? Oh, that sounds like fun. Can I just say that I'd like anybody to be the next president of the United States. Right away, please.\"\n\nNow, Clooney\u2019s latest actions have fans wondering if he might actually run for office. Clooney and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, pledged $500,000 to help fund the U.S. student-run march on Washington. Called the \u201cMarch for Our Lives,\u201d it\u2019s taking place on March 24th, along with sister rallies across the country. The march is a response to the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that took the lives of 17 people, and it\u2019s a way for the students who survived to take some serious action to demand gun control reform.\n\nShortly after the Clooneys made their donation, rumors hit the news circuit.\n\nFox News host and Donald Trump supporter Sean Hannity expressed his support, saying, \u201cMy attitude is, \u2018Run, George, run.\u2019 If George Clooney wants to run, I\u2019m all for it. I think Oprah Winfrey would be infinitely better as a candidate than George Clooney.\u201d\n\nHannity\u2019s comments are sarcastic. What he\u2019s trying to say is that he doesn\u2019t think Clooney has a chance at winning, which is why he would want him to run \u2014 so that Trump could win again.\n\nIs there a chance Clooney might actually make a move?\n\nMost likely not. His original comment about running was a joke, and when fans ran with it, Clooney cleared up any confusion in an interview with Variety, during which he said he doesn\u2019t think celebrities should hold the position. He stated,\n\n\" I think that having a celebrity as president who has a star on Hollywood Boulevard will exorcise our need to have someone famous in office. And maybe we\u2019ll find someone who knows how to make policy.\"", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F20%2Fsex-anxiety-tout.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F02%2F09%2FSwimsuits.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F17%2Fboob-sweat.jpg", "http://hellogiggles.com/img/misc/300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Fyuliya-kosolapova-bqirdOGHvYQ-unsplash-e1573767747444.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F01%2F05%2FJessicaBooth1-300x225-1.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F07%2F08%2Fchiron-retrograde-2021.jpg", "http://hellogiggles.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F06%2F08%2Ffriendquestions-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1000&h=500&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fgeorge-clooney.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fdream_about_ex.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1000&h=500&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fgeorge-clooney.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Booth", "Updated Feb"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/george-clooney-president-2020/", "title": "George Clooney for President of the United States in 2020?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Many are wondering: George Clooney for President of the United States in 2020?
