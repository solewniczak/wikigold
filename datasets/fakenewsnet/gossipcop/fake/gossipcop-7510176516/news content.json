On her Instagram account, McGowan said \"there are powerful forces at work\" and pleaded for others to \"be my voice.\"\n\nTwitter issued a statement late Thursday morning explaining the decision. It said McGowan's account \"was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number, which violates of our Terms of Service.\"\n\nTwitter added that the tweet was removed and her account has been unlocked.\n\nThe Tweet was removed and her account has been unlocked. We will be clearer about these policies and decisions in the future. 2/3 \u2014 Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 12, 2017\n\n\"Twitter is proud to empower and support the voices on our platform, especially those that speak truth to power,\" the company said in a statement. \"We stand with the brave women and men who use Twitter to share their stories, and will work hard every day to improve our processes to protect those voices.\"\n\nThe New York Times earlier reported that McGowan was among the numerous women sexually harassed by Weinstein, who paid McGowan a financial settlement in 1997.\n\nMcGowan on Tuesday tweeted \"now I am allowed to say rapist.\"\n\nMcGowan also recently called Ben Affleck \"a liar\" on Twitter and suggested the actor knew about Weinstein's conduct. Representatives for Affleck haven't responded to messages regarding that allegation.\n\nMcGowan's suspension on Twitter prompted an outcry from some accusing the social media site of selective censorship. Twitter has repeatedly come under fire for failing to effectively rein in hate speech and vitriol directed at women on its platform.\n\nAnthony Bourdain and Jamie Lee Curtis were among those to react sharply to McGowan's account being suspended:\n\nAnd now THIS? You allow Twitter freedom to our president but you silence a woman speaking out about sexual harassment? @rosemcgowan \u2014 Jamie Lee Curtis (@jamieleecurtis) October 12, 2017\n\nEveryone go into @rosemcgowan's account and RT three recent tweets. I cannot believe she's being muzzled on twitter. ON TWITTER. \u2014 Scott Weinberg (@scottEweinberg) October 12, 2017\n\nTrump threatens nuclear war: no problem Racism/homophobia/threats? No problem. Rose McGowan calling people out? Banned from Twitter. \u2014 Simon Brew (@simonbrew) October 12, 2017", "images": ["https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/01/14/8dc9f644-ee6d-494b-9351-480a4e2cd0c0/thumbnail/140x90/500f21988851f7645bf1233a4505926f/india-bishop-rape-ap22014415007157.jpg#", "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2016/07/06/541fdfbc-d0c4-49b9-9ad7-d23d5fb4169f/gettyimages-523442650.jpg", "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/08/16/39edf8f7-4bd0-4f81-8619-0126763386af/thumbnail/140x90g2/ab3274aaec22e06b49df555d09fd0c7e/gettyimages-1234420097.jpg#", "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/10/29/8565a004-a848-4a7c-91df-b975734f038e/thumbnail/140x90/4af146db2911bfb0e93b4360b2341dc8/ap21222621501855.jpg#", "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/09/3baa0cf8-f9dc-420f-bfe3-bbcb28e930b1/thumbnail/620x349g2/566d6613c1100ec50458d493997a76ff/harvey-weinstein-getty-687430878.jpg#", "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/07/06/541fdfbc-d0c4-49b9-9ad7-d23d5fb4169f/thumbnail/1200x630g2/8be95fb130ace0928708cf18dfdfecfb/gettyimages-523442650.jpg", "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/08/04/a33fe8c4-2abc-489a-add3-1b199d072ac5/thumbnail/140x90/840faf0c0cc657a283d99ea06a218582/gettyimages-162843671.jpg#"], "top_img": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/07/06/541fdfbc-d0c4-49b9-9ad7-d23d5fb4169f/thumbnail/1200x630g2/8be95fb130ace0928708cf18dfdfecfb/gettyimages-523442650.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rose-mcgowan-twitter-account-suspended-harvey-weinstein-allegations/", "title": "Twitter explains suspending Rose McGowan's account", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "color-scheme": "only light", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "description": "McGowan&#039;s Twitter account was suspended overnight, temporarily muting a central figure in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein", "al": {"web": {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rose-mcgowan-twitter-account-suspended-harvey-weinstein-allegations/"}, "ios": {"app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223, "url": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/rose-mcgowan-twitter-account-suspended-harvey-weinstein-allegations/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews", "url": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/rose-mcgowan-twitter-account-suspended-harvey-weinstein-allegations/"}}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rose-mcgowan-twitter-account-suspended-harvey-weinstein-allegations/", "title": "Twitter explains suspending Rose McGowan's account", "description": "McGowan's Twitter account was suspended overnight, temporarily muting a central figure in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein", "image": {"identifier": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/07/06/541fdfbc-d0c4-49b9-9ad7-d23d5fb4169f/thumbnail/1200x630g2/8be95fb130ace0928708cf18dfdfecfb/gettyimages-523442650.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267, "pages": 131459315949}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSNewsEntertainment/", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"iphone": "CBS News", "ipad": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"iphone": 334256223, "ipad": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/rose-mcgowan-twitter-account-suspended-harvey-weinstein-allegations/", "ipad": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/rose-mcgowan-twitter-account-suspended-harvey-weinstein-allegations/", "googleplay": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/rose-mcgowan-twitter-account-suspended-harvey-weinstein-allegations/"}}, "site": "@CBSNews", "title": "Twitter explains suspending Rose McGowan's account", "description": "McGowan's Twitter account was suspended overnight, temporarily muting a central figure in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein", "image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/07/06/541fdfbc-d0c4-49b9-9ad7-d23d5fb4169f/thumbnail/1200x630g2/8be95fb130ace0928708cf18dfdfecfb/gettyimages-523442650.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "theme-color": "#101010", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "CBS News", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.cbsnews.com", "summary": ""}
