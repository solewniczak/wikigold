Maggie finds herself at an awkward family dinner, Jackson receives big news, and Richard and Bailey search for the stars of tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe introduction of new blood comes as Grey\u2019s has gone through a bit of a casting shakeup. Jerrika Hinton, Tessa Ferrer, and Marika Domi\u0144czyk all exited after the close of season 13, while Bridget Regan, who originally played Owen\u2019s (Kevin McKidd) presumed-dead sister, was recast with Abigail Spencer. Former series regular Kim Raver also returned, while Italian actress Stefania Spampinato joined the series as DeLuca\u2019s (Giacomo Gianniotti) sister.\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F03%2F08%2F156863_25748.jpg",
