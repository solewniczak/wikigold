See Why Her Swifties Are Split\n\nTaylor Swift dropped the second song off her upcoming album Reputation on Sunday morning, causing a massive debate amongst her Swifties on social media over the inspiration behind \u201c\u2026Ready for It.\u201d\n\nMany immediately went wild for the catchy tune (read the full lyrics here) saying it was written about her boyfriend Joe Alwyn, whom Swift has been dating since late last year.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cSome boys are trying too hard / He don\u2019t try at all though / Younger than my exes but he acts like such a man, though,\u201d sings Swift, 27, on the track.\n\nAlwyn, 26, is seven years younger than Calvin Harris and 10 years younger than Tom Hiddleston, whom Swift dated before the British actor.\n\nJust as many fans, however, are positive the song was inspired by Harry Styles. Though she\u2019s never confirmed the rumors, many believe her hit songs \u201cStyle\u201d and \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d off her 1989 album were written about the former One Direction singer, who is 23 years old.\n\nStyles\u2019 song \u201cTwo Ghosts\u201d off his recent solo album is rumored to be a direct response to Swift\u2019s \u201cStyle\u201d because of his lyrics \u201cSame lips red, same eyes blue / Same white shirt, couple more tattoos.\u201d In \u201cStyle,\u201d she sings \u201cI got that red lip, classic thing that you like \u2026 You got that long hair slicked back, white T-shirt.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F06%2Ftaylor-swift-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F06%2Ftaylor-swift-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melody Chiu", "September"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-ready-for-it-joe-alwyn-harry-styles-inspiration/", "title": "Is Taylor Swift's '...Ready for It' About Joe Alwyn or Harry Styles?
