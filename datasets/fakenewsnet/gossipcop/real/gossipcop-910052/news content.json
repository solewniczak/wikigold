With Bruno Mars sweeping the major categories , Fonsi and Yankee weren\u2019t able to make that historic stride forward, but the Puerto Rican artists remained positive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not leaving empty-handed tonight,\u201d wrote Fonsi on Instagram following the award show. \u201cTo be able to break the language barrier and unite the world with a song is the best prize anyone can win. Let\u2019s continue sharing our culture and our Latin music with the entire world. Thanks for supporting us, this is just the beginning.\u201d\n\nFor Fonsi, the Grammy nod \u2014 and potential win \u2014 was all about celebrating his Latin heritage and pride. Before the ceremony, he spoke to ET about what the evening meant to him. \u201cThis is really big,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only for me, but for Latin music in general, to be able to sing a song in Spanish for the big show. I\u2019m really proud to be here. Being from Puerto Rico, growing up here in the United States, I\u2019ve always been so proud of my roots and my language, and all these artists who are performing, they\u2019ve all influenced me. So to be able to celebrate a little bit of who I am and where I\u2019m from, and to share with the world, and break that language barrier \u2014 especially after everything that [Puerto Rico has] been going through.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-911511418-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-911511418-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-911511418-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thatiana Diaz", "January"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/chica/luis-fonsi-and-daddy-yankee-respond-to-grammy-snub/", "title": "Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee React to Zero Grammy Wins for 'Despacito'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Daddy Yankee,Luis Fonsi", "news_keywords": "Daddy Yankee,Luis Fonsi", "description": "Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee walked away with zero wins at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards,\u00a0but the Puerto Rican artists thanked fans in positive post-ceremony messages.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee React to Zero Grammy Wins for 'Despacito'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/chica/luis-fonsi-and-daddy-yankee-respond-to-grammy-snub/", "description": "Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee walked away with zero wins at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards,\u00a0but the Puerto Rican artists thanked fans in positive post-ceremony messages.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-911511418-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/chica/luis-fonsi-and-daddy-yankee-respond-to-grammy-snub/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-911511418-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/chica/luis-fonsi-and-daddy-yankee-respond-to-grammy-snub/", "title": "Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee React to Zero Grammy Wins for 'Despacito'", "description": "Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee walked away with zero wins at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards,\u00a0but the Puerto Rican artists thanked fans in positive post-ceremony messages.", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-911511418-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/chica/luis-fonsi-and-daddy-yankee-respond-to-grammy-snub/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
