Announcing the news on her website at the time, Kim exclaimed: \"SHE'S HERE!\"\n\n\"Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,\" she wrote.\n\n\"We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care.\"\n\n\"North and Saint are especially thrilled to welcome their baby sister.\"\n\nkimkardashianwest.com\n\nA little more about the woman who carried Kim's child was revealed after she was introduced to the family on an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nOn the season 14 finale, La'Reina Haynes made her on-screen debut two months after giving birth to Kim and Kanye's third child. While her face wasn't shown on screen, she did speak to the family about how special it was - and she's giving us all the feels. Kris thanked La'Reina for the gesture, to which she responded:\n\n\"Thank you. I'm so proud of doing it in general.\n\n\"Like, with all the women who do have pregnancy issues, that put so much trust in people like me. It's amazing. It's already a big deal.\"\n\nWhen asked if she found it difficult to carry another couple's baby, she explained,\n\n\"I like being pregnant. I know it sounds really weird,\n\n\"The pregnancy itself, you know, it just feels natural, like I'm supposed to do it. Because I know from the very beginning this is not my baby. And at the end, my joy and my satisfaction is with whoever I'm having the baby for,\n\n\"I know what my job is in all of it. It makes me feel important because I'm like, 'Wow, I did something so good.' This is beautiful. I would do this again a thousand more times.\"\n\nBeing a surrogate is an amazing thing, but carrying the baby of pop culture royalty doesn't come without a monetary reward.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIt's believed the couple agreed to pay $45,000 in 10 monthly instalments of $4,500, according to a TMZ report. This is an addition to the $68,850 deposit given to the agency.\n\nKim was told by doctors that she wouldn't be able to survive another natural birth and admitted that she \"begged\" younger sister Khloe to be her surrogate.\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians , the 36-year-old mother-of-two was seen considering all the different options available for her to have another child.\n\n\"I have had to go through multiple things to try and do it on my own but I do not think that is looking good for me but I am not giving up,\" she told Watch What Happens Live.\n\n\"So it is a process. You kind of see the whole thing on this next season of our show, of me begging Khloe to help out,\" she added. \"But I do not want to do that to her.\"\n\nShe later revealed that both her older sister, Kourtney and mother, Kris Jenner, had offered to carry her third child for her.\n\nYoutube / E! Entertainment\n\nIn previous episodes of the show, Kim spoke about plans to get surgery on her uterus to help her conceive...\n\nShe asked her mother Kris: \"Should I try to change my surgery? I have to go in and prepare my uterus because I decided I'm going to try to have one more baby.\"\n\n\"So what surgery are you having?\" sister Khloe chipped in.\n\nKim explained: \"I have to have a surgery on my uterus, to kind of repair this hole. So they need to like, clean that out, and there's like scar tissue. It'll also be a really high-risk pregnancy just I would be able to get pregnant.\"\n\nA shocked Khloe asked: \"So why do you want to do it again?\" to which she replied: \"Having more kids is definitely gonna be a struggle. I've gone through so much with really bad deliveries that the doctors don't think it's safe for me to conceive again myself.\n\n\"This surgery is really the one last thing I can try. I want my kids to have siblings, and I want to know that I did everything that I could to make this happen.\"\n\nIn another clip from the show, the star said that despite her previous difficult pregnancies and deliveries, she wants to try again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try to have one more baby,\u201d she said before adding. \u201cI want my kids to have siblings but the doctors don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for me.\u201d\n\nIn the same episode, her mum Kris Jenner was heard urging her to think about her health.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to do something that puts you in danger,\u201d she said.\n\nKim Kardashain/Snapchat\n\nLuckily for Kim, she found someone to give her the family of her dreams.\n\nScroll down to see other celebrities who have had children via
