Perspective and life experience is everything,\u201d Parker remarked. \u201cI think the value of being a sophisticated woman and choosing marriage is promising, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nAgreeing, Paltrow commented on how difficult it is to choose the right partner when you get married at a young age. \u201cIt\u2019s such a crazy game of chance because who knows if you\u2019re going to grow in parallel, if your paths are going to diverge, [or] what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she said.\n\ngwyneth-paltrow Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Falchuk | Credit: Splash News\n\nPaltrow and Falchuk first met in 2010 when she made a guest appearance on Glee as Holly Holliday, a role for which she won an Emmy Award.

went on to ask Parker, who has been married to Matthew Broderick since 1997, if she had any insight on \u201cthe things that keep people growing together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Parker replied, adding that something she\u2019s noticed recently is that while there are always going to be things about your partner that irritate you, getting upset about the small things doesn\u2019t really matter in the long run.\n\n\u201cYeah it bothers me,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut I also try to remember or think of how many things I do that must really bother him.\u201d\n\n2018 Tribeca Film Festival After-Party For Blue Night Hosted By Nespresso At The Ainsworth Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick | Credit: Dia Dipasupil/Getty\n\nPaltrow went on to
