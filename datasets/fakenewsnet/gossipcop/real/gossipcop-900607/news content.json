Predictably, the feedback was sharply divided, with some admiring Davidson\u2019s new ink and others lambasting his \u201cawful\u201d choice.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMesa, the tattoo artist tagged in Davidson\u2019s post, uploaded a picture of the same tattoo Friday night on his own Instagram account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA call to Mesa\u2019s tattoo shop, No Idols Tattoo in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown, confirmed that the Instagram posts were not a joke or part of some elaborate SNL setup: Davidson did in fact get inked with a mini portrait of Clinton on his right leg Thursday night, a woman who answered the phone at the shop Saturday told The Washington Post. (The woman relayed brief messages shouted across the parlor by Mesa, who was not immediately available for comment because he was busy tattooing another client, she said.)\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what led to Davidson\u2019s decision or the artistic process that prompted Mesa to draw Clinton with slightly longer-than-usual hair and a structured, button-down suit jacket. But among the fans of the new tattoo was apparently Clinton herself.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThanks, @petedavidson. This makes it significantly less awkward that I\u2019ve had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years,\u201d the former secretary of state wrote in a comment on Davidson\u2019s Instagram post. \u201cBut seriously, I\u2019m honored. Merry Christmas my friend.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavidson simply replied: \u201cOMG WHAAAAAAAAT!!!!\u201d according to an image of the exchange captured by Entertainment Weekly\u2019s Jillian Sederholm.\n\nA spokesman for Clinton confirmed the exchange was real \u2014 and that she was, in fact, joking about also having a tattoo of Davidson.\n\n\u201c[Clinton] saw Pete\u2019s Instagram post on a flight back from L.A. to New York and replied from her account,\u201d Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told The Post in an email. \u201cAnd that is correct, while she is fond Pete Davidson, she has no tattoos of him \u2026 yet.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn 2014, Davidson became one of the youngest cast members on SNL when he joined the show at age 20. The comic, who frequently joked about marijuana in SNL sketches, made headlines earlier this year when he announced he was sober \u201cfor the first time in 8 years.\u201d\n\nThis post has been updated.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-03-07/AP/People_Pete_Davidson_96371-02291.jpg&w=1440"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-03-07/AP/People_Pete_Davidson_96371-02291.jpg&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2017/12/16/an-snl-cast-member-got-a-hillary-clinton-tattoo-on-his-leg-she-says-shes-honored/", "title": "An SNL cast member got a Hillary Clinton tattoo on his leg.
