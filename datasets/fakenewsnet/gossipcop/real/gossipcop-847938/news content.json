When organizing the folded clothing you'll store on shelves, place heavier items at the bottom of the pile, and lighter ones at the top. After folding, arrange garments by function (workout tops together, business tops together, etc.) and color (white to nude to bright colors to black). If your closet doesn't have shelves, consider using part of your clothing rod for hanging canvas ones.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F23%2F2020%2F12%2F15%2Fhow-much-money-to-keep-in-bank-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F23%2F2021%2F11%2F17%2Fhow-to-measure-ring-size-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F23%2F2021%2F07%2F15%2Fgreat-books-for-anytime-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F23%2F2020%2F11%2F16%2Fwhat-is-anhedonia-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.realsimple.com/img/misc/300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.realsimple.com/img/misc/og-default.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F23%2F2020%2F10%2F09%2FGreen-hangers.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F23%2F2020%2F06%2F02%2Fhow-to-host-a-powerpoint-slideshow-party-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F23%2F2017%2F12%2F29%2Flactose-free-cheese-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F23%2F2020%2F11%2F13%2Frefrigerator-freezer-fridge-temperature-guidelines-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.realsimple.com/img/misc/og-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/organizing/closets/clothes-closet-organizing-checklist", "title": "Clothing Closet Organizing Checklist", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Following these steps to an organized closet will help ensure that getting dressed every day is a fast and easy routine.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Clothing Closet Organizing Checklist", "type": "article", "site_name": "Real Simple", "url": "https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/organizing/closets/clothes-closet-organizing-checklist", "description": "Make getting dressed fast and easy: Organize your closet in just a few easy steps.", "image": "https://www.realsimple.com/img/misc/og-default.png"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/organizing/closets/clothes-closet-organizing-checklist", "media": "https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2020/10/09/Green-hangers.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/organizing/closets/clothes-closet-organizing-checklist", "title": "Clothing Closet Organizing Checklist", "description": "Make getting dressed fast and easy: Organize your closet in just a few easy steps.", "image": "https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2020/10/09/Green-hangers.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 165082593548215, "pages": 10053803772}, "url": "https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/organizing/closets/clothes-closet-organizing-checklist"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.realsimple.com", "summary": ""}
