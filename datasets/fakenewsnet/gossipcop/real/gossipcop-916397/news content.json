On Sunday she took to social media to announce her newest shade: a bright, bright, bright pink.\n\nWe had a hint something was coming on Saturday, when she basically sounded an alarm for a future color drop: \"I can't even tell you how over my blond hair I am!\" she tweet-raged. (As someone who is a very much dyed platinum blond too, I can attest that we all have those days.)\n\nKardashian West, however, did something about it. A big something. Although she hinted that she was a \"brunette at heart\" during a Create + Cultivate panel on Saturday, she definitely didn't go back to her roots with her recent dye job. Instead, she went bold\u2014and it's pretty great.\n\nJudging by the multiple reveal posts, she's excited about it too.\n\nAs for those of us wondering\u2014quite rightly, given younger sis Kylie Jenner's former penchant for mixing up her look with wigs\u2014if the look is indeed a wig, temporary, or permanent, Kim put down any confusion on Twitter before it could begin. \"I wonder if it\u2019s just a wig or permanent color? because we know Kim doesn\u2019t play with wigs,\" one user posited.", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9328bc19724717d28d5899/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kim-k-blonde-hair-getty.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9328bc19724717d28d5899/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/kim-k-blonde-hair-getty.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9328bc19724717d28d5899/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kim-k-blonde-hair-getty.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Krystin Arneson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/kim-kardashian-just-dyed-her-hair-bright-pink", "title": "Kim Kardashian Just Dyed Her Hair Bright Pink", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Kim Kardashian has gone from brown to blond and now to pink, according to social media posts over the weekend.", "id": "5a9321f2c0cda831d24f4331", "keywords": "kim kardashian", "news_keywords": "kim kardashian", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a9321f2c0cda831d24f4331", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Kim Kardashian has gone from brown to blond and now to pink, according to social media posts over the weekend.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9328bc19724717d28d5899/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/kim-k-blonde-hair-getty.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9328bc19724717d28d5899/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/kim-k-blonde-hair-getty.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "This is a WHOLE new look from her.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9328bc19724717d28d5899/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kim-k-blonde-hair-getty.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Kim Kardashian Just Dyed Her Hair Bright (Very Bright!)
