The character is played by Ames McNamara.\n\n\u201cI thought I had to reach out to Johnny Galecki \u2019cause this is our kid together,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I texted him, what do you think we should name our baby boy? And then I said, \u2018Oh, maybe Mark,\u2019 because Mark was played by Glenn Quinn who was [Galecki\u2019s] brother on the show who passed away.\u201d\n\nSARA GILBERT, AMES MCNAMARA Credit: Adam Rose/ABC\n\nEarlier this year, Gilbert explained why she decided to have Mark dress up like a girl.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s based on a few kids in my life that are boys who dress in more traditionally feminine clothing,\u201d she told EW. \u201cHe\u2019s too young to be gay and he doesn\u2019t identify as transgender, but he just likes wearing that kind of clothing and that\u2019s where he is at this point in his life.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F11%2Flynette-rice-image.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2F147920_9501-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2F147920_9501-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2F147920_9501-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lynette Rice", "April", "At Pm Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/16/johnny-galecki-sara-gilbert-roseanne/", "title": "How Johnny Galecki helped Sara Gilbert name their son on Roseanne", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Johnny Galecki,Sara Gilbert", "news_keywords": "Johnny Galecki,Sara Gilbert", "description": "Johnny Galecki will only make one appearance on\u00a0'Roseanne' this season as David, but he played a role in naming one of the characters on the comedy.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "How Johnny Galecki helped Sara Gilbert name their son on 'Roseanne'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/16/johnny-galecki-sara-gilbert-roseanne/", "description": "Johnny Galecki will only make one appearance on\u00a0'Roseanne' this season as David, but he played a role in naming one of the characters on the comedy.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2F147920_9501-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/16/johnny-galecki-sara-gilbert-roseanne/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2F147920_9501-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/16/johnny-galecki-sara-gilbert-roseanne/", "title": "How Johnny Galecki helped Sara Gilbert name their son on 'Roseanne'", "description": "Johnny Galecki will only make one appearance on\u00a0'Roseanne' this season as David, but he played a role in naming one of the characters on the comedy.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2F147920_9501-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/16/johnny-galecki-sara-gilbert-roseanne/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523829600.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
