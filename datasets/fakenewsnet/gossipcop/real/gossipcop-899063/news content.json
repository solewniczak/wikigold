The rapper wears a full-body, high-neck custom latex catsuit by Vex Clothing underneath a mirrored corset, finishing off the look with pink braids that extend to the very bottom of her translucent PVC thigh-high heeled boots. In fact, this could be her most radical take on the Barbie trope yet.", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cbde39a5255ddb2d2c/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/00-story-migos-nicki-minaj.gif", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.00b68c0d9934396a2a234f4f43427e3affd58e9b.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb69b3cf6467ebebdb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-migos-nicki-minaj.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.02dcb2fef16d86c695ce8d290a3fd13c7f6c3182.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.f2c4cf0289092a5686b7c6db87806b427e705af9.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb69b3cf6467ebebdb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-migos-nicki-minaj.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Rachel Hahn"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/migos-cardi-b-motorsport-music-video-moto-cross-latex-bodysuit-pink-braids", "title": "Nicki Minaj Is a Futuristic Barbie in Migos\u2019s Neon Bright Video for \u201cMotorsport\u201d", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "While \u201cMotorsport\u201d features some bold motocross-inspired looks from Quavo, Takeoff, Offset, and Cardi B, it\u2019s Minaj\u2019s futuristic bodysuit that ultimately shines the brightest.", "id": "5a2b169bc16b071bbc37108c", "keywords": "music videos", "news_keywords": "music videos", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a2b169bc16b071bbc37108c", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"While \u201cMotorsport\u201d features some bold motocross-inspired looks from Quavo, Takeoff, Offset, and Cardi B, it\u2019s Minaj\u2019s futuristic bodysuit that ultimately shines the brightest.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb94a13738da830273/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-migos-nicki-minaj.gif\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb94a13738da830273/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-migos-nicki-minaj.gif\"}", "og": {"description": "While \u201cMotorsport\u201d features some bold motocross-inspired looks from Quavo, Takeoff, Offset, and Cardi B, it\u2019s Minaj\u2019s futuristic bodysuit that ultimately shines the brightest.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb69b3cf6467ebebdb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-migos-nicki-minaj.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Nicki Minaj Is a Futuristic Barbie in Migos\u2019s Neon Bright Video for \u201cMotorsport\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/migos-cardi-b-motorsport-music-video-moto-cross-latex-bodysuit-pink-braids"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-12-08T22:56:55.606Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb69b3cf6467ebebdb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-migos-nicki-minaj.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512773815.606, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
