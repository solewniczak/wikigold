(Her husband, Paul, is Boy George\u2019s manager.)\n\nPEOPLE first reported back in June that Richards was in talks to join the reality TV franchise; a source said at the time that the deal was \u201cnot final yet\u201d but \u201cvery close.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone is really excited about the possibility of having her on board!\u201d said the insider.\n\nThe Wild Things star had been rumored to be in discussions with producers for years, but \u201cthe timing was never right,\u201d a second source close to the show told PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cDenise has been wanting to join the show for a long time,\u201d the source explained. \u201cShe\u2019s a huge Housewives fan and watches all of the shows. And she has close relationships with many of the women in real life, including Kyle and Lisa Rinna .\u201d\n\n\u201cThe timing was never right for her in the past, but the producers needed to shake the dynamic of the show up after a season without much conflict,\u201d the source continued. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be a great fit. She\u2019s not afraid of the drama. And she lives a glamorous, Hollywood life \u2014 which the show looks for.\u201d", "images":
