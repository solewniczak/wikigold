The company is seeking damages for copyright infringement, as well as any profits derived from the image. Hadid removed Xclusive's photo from her Instagram page shortly after sharing, but the suit also alleges that this was not the only instance she has posted unlicensed images. In the documents, Hadid's Instagram account includes at least fifty examples of uncredited photographs of Hadid in public, at press events, or on the runway.[122] This was also not the first time Hadid is being sued for posting photos of herself on her social media account. In 2017, photographer Peter Cepeda took a photo of her, which she later posted on Instagram without his permission. He filed a lawsuit against her the following September and it was later settled outside of court.[122]\n\nFilmography\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nSee also", "images": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Gigi_Hadid_2016.png/170px-Gigi_Hadid_2016.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/AnnaSui-FW17RTW-Hadids-BW_%28cropped%29.jpg/170px-AnnaSui-FW17RTW-Hadids-BW_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/BathingSuit1920s.jpg/32px-BathingSuit1920s.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Gigi_Hadid._2015.jpg/220px-Gigi_Hadid._2015.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Gigi_Hadid_Stuart_Weitzman.jpg/220px-Gigi_Hadid_Stuart_Weitzman.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Gigi_Hadid._2015.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Gigi_Hadid_amFAR_2015.png/170px-Gigi_Hadid_amFAR_2015.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Gigi_Hadid._2015.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigi_Hadid", "title": "Gigi Hadid", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.38.0-wmf.25", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Gigi_Hadid._2015.jpg/640px-Gigi_Hadid._2015.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 800}, "title": "Gigi Hadid - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
