There\u2019s something missing and I want to give you a housewarming gift so it\u2019s gonna go on that shelf,\u201d DeGeneres said before whipping out a shiny new Crock-Pot with a big red bow.\n\n\u201cI will remember to unplug this after I\u2019m done using it,\u201d Moore added with a laugh, referencing the kitchen appliance that played a part in the demise of her TV husband played by Milo Ventimiglia.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Mandy Moore on Working With Milo Ventimiglia on \u2018This Is Us\u2019: \u201cIt\u2019s Easy to Pretend to Be in Love With Him\u201d\n\nThe episode resulted in many devastated fans turning their backs on their Crock-Pots. To make good with the brand, This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman and Ventimiglia created a hilarious Super Bowl ad with the hashtag #CrockPotIsInnocent. Ventimiglia also stopped by DeGeneres\u2019 show to come to the tool\u2019s defense.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fmandy-moore1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fmandy-moore1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "March"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/mandy-moore-plays-why-is-mandy-crying-ellen-degeneres/", "title": "Mandy Moore Plays 'Why is Mandy Crying' with Ellen DeGeneres", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Ellen DeGeneres,Mandy Moore,News,The Ellen DeGeneres Show", "news_keywords": "Ellen DeGeneres,Mandy Moore,News,The Ellen DeGeneres Show", "description": "Mandy Moore is an expert at crying, but even she had difficulties playing one of Ellen Degeneres' silly games", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Mandy Moore Tries Not to Laugh While Playing 'Why Is Mandy Crying' with Ellen &mdash; Watch the Hilarious Video!", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/mandy-moore-plays-why-is-mandy-crying-ellen-degeneres/", "description": "Mandy Moore is an expert at crying, but even she had difficulties playing one of Ellen Degeneres' silly games", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fmandy-moore1.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/mandy-moore-plays-why-is-mandy-crying-ellen-degeneres/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fmandy-moore1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/mandy-moore-plays-why-is-mandy-crying-ellen-degeneres/", "title": "Mandy Moore Tries Not to Laugh While Playing 'Why Is Mandy Crying' with Ellen &mdash; Watch the Hilarious Video!", "description": "Mandy Moore is an expert at crying, but even she had difficulties playing one of Ellen Degeneres' silly games", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fmandy-moore1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/mandy-moore-plays-why-is-mandy-crying-ellen-degeneres/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSFJaehzNi4"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
