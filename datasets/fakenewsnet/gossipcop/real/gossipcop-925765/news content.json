However, it wasn't until New Year's Eve that Underwood, 35, revealed the fall also caused severe cuts to her face.\n\n\"There is also another part of the story that I haven't been ready to talk about since I have still been living it and there has been much uncertainty as to how things will end up,\" she wrote in a note to her fan club members. \"It's crazy how a freak random accident can change your life.\"\n\nShe continued: \"In addition to breaking my wrist, I somehow managed to injure my face as well. I'll spare you the gruesome details, but when I came out of surgery the night of my fall, the doctor told [Underwood's husband] Mike that he had put between 40 and 50 stitches in.\"\n\nSeven weeks after the accident, Underwood said that she's on the mend but \"not quite looking the same.\"\n\nHowever, several weeks earlier on Dec. 12, Below Deck alum Adrienne Gang posted a photo of herself posing with Underwood at the gym. After fans pointed out it was the first time Underwood had been photographed since her accident, Gang reassured them that she looked \"amazing\" and added that she had \"no clue\" Underwood was injured.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F08%2Fcarrie-underwood.jpg",
