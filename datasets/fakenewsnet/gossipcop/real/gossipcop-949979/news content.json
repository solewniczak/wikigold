The couple are also mom and dad to sons Drake, 13, and Duke, 10, and daughters Ella, 11, and Emmie Kay, 8.\n\nBack in April, Joanna said the idea of having kids around the house a bit longer is something they\u2019re both excited about.\n\n\u201cWe think about things like when Emmie goes off to college this little one will only be 10,\u201d she told PEOPLE in April. \u201cIt\u2019s just crazy to think how wide that gap is, but Chip just loves hanging out with the kids and it\u2019s just such a sweet thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s sweet because they\u2019re older now, and I can see them wanting to be a part of this,\u201d she added to PEOPLE in May. \u201cWe\u2019re all rallying around this baby, which I feel is a sweet gift to our family.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Joanna Gaines Snuggles with Her \u2018Cuddle Bug,\u2019 Newborn Baby Crew \u2014 See the Photo\n\nTwo days after Crew\u2019s birth, the proud parents were back at home in Waco, Texas, with their healthy son and plunging back into roles with which they\u2019ve had plenty of practice.\n\nChip, 43, and Joanna typically split diaper duty, but he\u2019s in charge of swaddling: \u201cChip\u2019s always been able to rock our babies to sleep,\u201d Joanna told PEOPLE.\n\nFor more on Chip and Joanna, pick up this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE \u2014 on newsstands now\n\ncover Credit: Perry Hagopian\n\nNow after their year of surprises (including Crew arriving more than two weeks early), the pair have never been happier to leave the future open-ended.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to what\u2019s to come, and what\u2019s to come, we have no idea,\u201d Joanna said. \u201cI think one thing about me and Chip is that we never like to look really far in advance and plan, that\u2019s never been how we are. I joke with my friends that I\u2019m going to be that 45-year-old who\u2019s pregnant.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1602&h=801&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fbaby.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F248515971_423792849226570_1672372709981615183_n.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fcover3-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1602&h=801&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fbaby.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn", "June"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/joanna-gaines-newborn-son-crew-nursery/", "title": "Joanna Gaines Says Newborn Son Crew Is 'Settling in Just Fine' in His Nursery \u2014 See the Photo!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Chip and Joanna Gaines,Fixer Upper,Joanna Gaines,News", "news_keywords": "Chip and Joanna Gaines,Fixer Upper,Joanna Gaines,News", "description": "Joanna Gaines\u00a0shared a new photo of her newborn son Crew to Instagram on Saturday, giving an update on how he's doing in the comments section", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Joanna Gaines Says Newborn Son Crew Is 'Settling in Just Fine' in His Nursery &mdash; See the Photo!", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/joanna-gaines-newborn-son-crew-nursery/", "description": "Joanna Gaines\u00a0shared a new photo of her newborn son Crew to Instagram on Saturday, giving an update on how he's doing in the comments section", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1602&h=801&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fbaby.jpg", "width": 1602, "height": 801}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/parents/joanna-gaines-newborn-son-crew-nursery/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fbaby.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/parents/joanna-gaines-newborn-son-crew-nursery/", "title": "Joanna Gaines Says Newborn Son Crew Is 'Settling in Just Fine' in His Nursery &mdash; See the Photo!", "description": "Joanna Gaines\u00a0shared a new photo of her newborn son Crew to Instagram on Saturday, giving an update on how he's doing in the comments section", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1602&h=801&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fbaby.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/parents/joanna-gaines-newborn-son-crew-nursery/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
