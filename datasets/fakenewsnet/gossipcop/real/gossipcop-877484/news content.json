Security asked the crowd not to rush her.\u201d\n\nA group of children and adults had gathered outside the church, hoping to catch a glimpse of Swift.\n\n\u201cThere were tons of people, all ages,\u201d the source continued. \u201cLots of tourists who wandered by and were like \u2018oh, Taylor Swift?'\u201d\n\nIn 2008, the Grammy winner released an emotional song on her Fearless album titled \u201cFifteen,\u201d which was partly inspired by her high school best friend.\n\n\u201cYou sit in class next to a red-head named Abigail / And soon enough you\u2019re best friends / Laughing at the other girls / Who think they\u2019re so cool / We\u2019ll be out of here as soon as we can,\u201d sings Swift on the track. \u201cAnd Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind / And we both cried.\u201d\n\nIn late July, Anderson \u2014 who was Swift\u2019s date to the Grammys in 2015 \u2014 shared photos on her Instagram from her bachelorette party in Cabo, but Swift was not pictured in her posts.\n\nHowever, she may have dropped a hint Swift was part of her bridal party when she shared an Instagram story in June that included a swag bag with the name \u201cTaylor\u201d on it.\n\ntaylor-swift-b Credit: Splash News\n\nThe \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d singer also celebrated her friend\u2019s engagement over Fourth of July weekend last year, complete with an \u201cABIGAIL AND MATT ENGAGED!\u201d banner.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s literally so much love around your only option is to make a room for all of your love banners & sing love songs to each other. @taylorswift we LOVE you!
