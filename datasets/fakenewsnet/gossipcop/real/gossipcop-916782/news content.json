I think you have some of mine,\u2019 \u201d she said, to which Disick replied: \u201cAnd you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking through your panties,\u201d the father of three quipped. \u201cI understand the boundary of not going into your bedroom because that\u2019s a private place for you.\u201d\n\nBut as Kardashian remembered, Disick didn\u2019t respect the boundary she put in place. \u201cThe day after I said it, you went right in. You said, \u2018Hey, can I come in?\u2019 and the kids were there. I wasn\u2019t going to be like, \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, there\u2019s obviously some boundaries that we both need to respect and I don\u2019t want you to be uncomfortable,\u201d said Disick. \u201cI get it. All things that are understandable in this co-parenting life.\u201d\n\nAfter discussing the boundaries that Kardashian wanted established in her house, Disick came up with his own.\n\n\u201cI was also thinking I have a boundary. I don\u2019t really wanna hug anymore,\u201d he sarcastically said. \u201cI think we should just shake hands when we see each other. Is that cool?\u201d\n\nBy the shaking of hands, the former couple agreed.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=750&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fkourtney-kardashian.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=750&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fkourtney-kardashian.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone", "March"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-boundaries/", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Asks Ex Scott Disick to Respect Her 'Boundaries' After He Enters Her Bedroom", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Couples,Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Kourtney Kardashian,News,Scott Disick", "news_keywords": "Couples,Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Kourtney Kardashian,News,Scott Disick", "description": "\"I just felt like we should discuss some of the boundaries in the house,\" Kourtney Kardashian told Scott Disick", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Kourtney Kardashian Asks Ex Scott Disick to Respect Her 'Boundaries' After He Enters Her Bedroom", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-boundaries/", "description": "\"I just felt like we should discuss some of the boundaries in the house,\" Kourtney Kardashian told Scott Disick", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=750&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fkourtney-kardashian.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 750}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-boundaries/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fkourtney-kardashian.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-boundaries/", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Asks Ex Scott Disick to Respect Her 'Boundaries' After He Enters Her Bedroom", "description": "\"I just felt like we should discuss some of the boundaries in the house,\" Kourtney Kardashian told Scott Disick", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=750&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fkourtney-kardashian.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-boundaries/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
