They didn\u2019t even cut anything. I just figured \u2014 I don\u2019t know what I figured.\u201d\n\nOf course, the New York City native has secured much more substantial roles since then. Shortly after his feature film debut in Jason Reitman\u2019s drama Men, Women & Children, he gained recognition for his supporting role in Greta Gerwig\u2019s Lady Bird, which was nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture. Chalamet also acted in another 2018 Academy favorite, Call Me By Your Name, for which he received his first nomination.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Steve Carell and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet Talk About Reality of Addiction in Beautiful Boy Featurette", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fintersteller.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fintersteller.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maura Hohman", "December"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/timothee-chalamet-cried-because-his-interstellar-part-was-so-small/", "title": "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet Admits He 'Wept' After Seeing Interstellar Because His Part Was So Small", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Emma Stone,News,Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet", "news_keywords": "Emma Stone,News,Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet", "description": "Even though Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet has become a big actor in recent months, he still has a history of small parts", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet Admits He 'Wept' After Seeing 'Interstellar' Because His Part Was So Small", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/timothee-chalamet-cried-because-his-interstellar-part-was-so-small/", "description": "Even though Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet has become a big actor in recent months, he still has a history of small parts", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fintersteller.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/movies/timothee-chalamet-cried-because-his-interstellar-part-was-so-small/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fintersteller.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/movies/timothee-chalamet-cried-because-his-interstellar-part-was-so-small/", "title": "Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet Admits He 'Wept' After Seeing 'Interstellar' Because His Part Was So Small", "description": "Even though Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet has become a big actor in recent months, he still has a history of small parts", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fintersteller.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/movies/timothee-chalamet-cried-because-his-interstellar-part-was-so-small/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/dlVpQI0-Sf8"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
