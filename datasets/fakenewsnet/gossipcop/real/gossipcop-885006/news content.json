The acts being nominated for the first time this year are Devo, Roxy Music, Stevie Nicks, Todd Rundgren, John Prine, and Def Leppard. The list of previously included nominees includes Radiohead, Rage Against the Machine, Janet Jackson, LL Cool J, The Cure, Kraftwerk, Rufus & Chaka Khan, MC5, and the Zombies. Of these, LL Cool J and Kraftwerk have been nominated the most times previously, with this being their fifth and fourth nominations, respectively.\n\nSeveral notable nominees from last year are not present on this year\u2019s list, including Kate Bush, Nine Inch Nails, the Smiths, the Replacements, Depeche Mode, Eric B. & Rakim, and others. No artists that became eligible for the first time this year were nominated. That potential list includes Outkast, Beck, Snoop Dogg, Jeff Buckley, Fugees, the Roots, and (finally, folks) Dave Matthews Band.\n\nThe members of last year\u2019s Rock Hall class were Nina Simone, The Cars, Bon Jovi, The Moody Blues, and Dire Straits. Bon Jovi was the favorite of that year\u2019s fan ballot tally by a long shot (Radiohead came in 12th). Fans\u2014hopefully ones with better taste\u2014can vote for their dream inductees at the Rock Hall\u2019s website now.", "images": ["https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/bloom-SPIN_IMPACT-Vol7-scaled.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/Boo-Radleys-Promo-July-202166351-160x160.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/Emily-Ulmer-scaled.jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20576'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://static.spin.com/files/2018/10/pjimage-39-1539092282-compressed.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/GettyImages-1354787400-scaled.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%201024'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://static.spin.com/files/2021/09/spin-logo.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=913237892731778&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20160%20160'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201080%20720'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20768%20768'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/SPIN-Site-Horizontal-Image-Template-DandoCover-160x160.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e7080d7334f409fe30104b1012f2958a?s=300&d=mm&r=g", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://static.spin.com/files/2021/09/SPIN-Newsletter-Header-08-768x768.png", "https://static.spin.com/files/2018/10/pjimage-39-1539092282-1024x576.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/bloom-SPIN_IMPACT-Vol6-scaled.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/02/bloom-SPIN_IMPACT-Vol5-1-scaled.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/DURAN_DURAN_420-copy.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/First-armadillo-1-160x160.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/03/Mothica-bts_MG_7924.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202560%201707'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://static.spin.com/files/2021/09/Logo-SPIN.svg"], "top_img": "https://static.spin.com/files/2018/10/pjimage-39-1539092282-compressed.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Winston Cook-Wilson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.spin.com/2018/10/rock-roll-hall-of-fame-2019-nominees-radiohead-rage-against-the-machine/", "title": "Rock & Roll Hall of Fame 2019 Nominees Include Radiohead, Rage Against the Machine, Janet Jackson, Stevie Nicks", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame has announced the nominees for their 2019 class, including Radiohead, Rage Against the Machine, Janet Jackson, and Stevie Nicks.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Rock & Roll Hall of Fame 2019 Nominees Include Radiohead, Rage Against the Machine, Janet Jackson, Stevie Nicks", "description": "The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame has announced the nominees for their 2019 class, including Radiohead, Rage Against the Machine, Janet Jackson, and Stevie Nicks.", "url": "https://www.spin.com/2018/10/rock-roll-hall-of-fame-2019-nominees-radiohead-rage-against-the-machine/", "site_name": "SPIN", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.spin.com/files/2018/10/pjimage-39-1539092282-compressed.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/spin", "published_time": "2018-10-09T13:47:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@spin", "site": "@spin", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Winston Cook-Wilson", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1539092822.0, "source": "https://www.spin.com", "summary": ""}
