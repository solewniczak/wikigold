The legendary actress and comedian will be brought to life in a new project starring Cate Blanchett and written by Aaron Sorkin, EW confirmed.\n\nThe movie will be produced by Ball\u2019s two children, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr., and will track Ball\u2019s life over the course of her 20-year marriage with I Love Lucy costar Desi Arnaz. Two TV movies have been about Ball: Lucy (2003), starring Rachel York, and Lucy & Desi (1991) with Frances Fisher and Maurice Bernard as the leads.\n\nLeading the Escape Artists (Southpaw) project are a pair of Oscar winners. Blanchett has nabbed two Academy Awards, one for Best Supporting Actress in The Aviator and a Best Actress for Blue Jasmine. Sorkin, the creator of The West Wing, earned his Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for The Social Network. Sorkin has another high-profile biopic bowing soon: Steve Jobs, out Oct. 9, starring Michael Fassbender.\n\nNeither Sorkin\u2019s reps nor Blanchett\u2019s reps immediately responded to EW\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe Wrap first reported this story.\n\nWANT MORE EW?
