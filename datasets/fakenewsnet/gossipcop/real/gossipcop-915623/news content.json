It\u2019s not the first time the VMAs opted out of a traditional emcee. Katy Perry took over the reigns last year after a similarly hostless show in 2016. Back in 2011, a series of high-profile presenters stepped in to steer the program (Remember Lady Gaga as the iconic Jo Calderone?).\n\nLuckily, Jennifer Lopez won\u2019t have to worry about handing herself the Video Vanguard Award (although, given her work ethic, she\u2019d find a way). The list of VMAs\u2019 presenters includes Tiffany Haddish, Kevin Hart, Millie Bobby Brown and Amandla Stenberg.\n\nThis year, Cardi B leads the way with 10 nominations, followed by music royalty Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 with eight nominations for their video \u201cAPES**T.\u201d Childish Gambino is a close third with seven nominations. The VMAs are back in New York for the first time in nine years at Radio City Music Hall.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Fsnag-3163-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Fsnag-3163-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joseph Longo", "August", "At Pm Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/music/2018/08/17/2018-vmas-no-host/", "title": "2018 MTV VMAs will air without a host", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "MTV Video Music Awards", "news_keywords": "MTV Video Music Awards", "description": "It's not the first time the awards show has gone solo.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "2018 MTV VMAs will air without a host", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/music/2018/08/17/2018-vmas-no-host/", "description": "It's not the first time the awards show has gone solo.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Fsnag-3163-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/music/2018/08/17/2018-vmas-no-host/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Fsnag-3163-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/music/2018/08/17/2018-vmas-no-host/", "title": "2018 MTV VMAs will air without a host", "description": "It's not the first time the awards show has gone solo.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Fsnag-3163-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/music/2018/08/17/2018-vmas-no-host/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1534456800.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
