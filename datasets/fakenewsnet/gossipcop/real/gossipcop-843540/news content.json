When her agent contacted her again, she told the actress that \u201cMean Town\u201d wasn\u2019t actually a show, it was an anagram for \u201cWoman Ten.\u201d Turns out, Mackie wasn\u2019t just auditioning for a poorly titled drama or sitcom, she was now in the running to become the newest female companion on \u201cDoctor Who\u201d Season 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was like, riiight, OK, I\u2019m never gonna get that,\u201d the London-born Mackie told The Huffington Post in a phone interview. Long story short, she did. After an initial audition, she performed lines alongside a theatrical Peter Capaldi, the resident Doctor entering into his final season as a time-traveling alien this year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s running pressing buttons and pulling levers, because he knows where everything is in the TARDIS,\u201d Mackie recounted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sort of just standing, open-mouthed, looking around in wonder, kind of thinking \u2015 What is going on here? This is the maddest experience of my life. I\u2019ve just had the most intense experience, and I can\u2019t even tell anyone about it.\u201d\n\nSecrecy is par for the course when it comes to the BBC show, which ran for 26 seasons between the 1960s and 1980s, only to return in a 2005 revival that\u2019s about to air its Season 10 premiere on BBC America on April 15. But Mackie\u2019s character, Bill Potts, is anything but traditional. According to The Guardian, she\u2019ll be the show\u2019s first openly gay companion, a woman who\u2019s been described as \u201ccompletely fresh and new,\u201d perhaps due in part to the fact that the actress behind the role has never really watched more than one episode of the show.\n\nCheck out our entire interview with Mackie, in which we talked about her character\u2019s persona, the pressures of joining the \u201cDoctor Who\u201d family, and what representation on television means to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love your character\u2019s name \u2015 Bill. Is there anything behind the name? Is it short for anything?\n\nWell, no, not as far as I know. She\u2019s just called Bill! I wondered the same, but I haven\u2019t discovered anything, unless they\u2019ve got big plans for a reveal later on. No, as far as I know, it\u2019s just Bill.\n\nFans have been speculating that Bill is from the \u201880s and that there might be a parallel to a former \u201cWho\u201d companion, Ace \u2015 is any of this true? I\u2019ve read that \u201cDoctor Who\u201d showrunner Steven Moffat has hinted otherwise.\n\nShe is not from the \u201880s, no. She is very much from now. She\u2019s very much a present-day woman. Kind of a normal young woman, really. Kind of a nod there, in her vintage-inspired outfits, but she\u2019s definitely not from the \u201880s.\n\nBBC America\n\nIs there anything else you can tell us about Bill\u2019s origins that won\u2019t incite utter rage from the BBC?\n\nYeah! In terms of personality, she\u2019s very open and she\u2019s very real. When I read Steven\u2019s script, I was very struck by how fully rounded the character was. Not sort of struck in terms of being surprised by Steven\u2019s writing \u2015 because, I mean, we all know how good that is \u2015 but it was very much more that I felt she was already there. She had a history. She felt like a real person that you would meet. And someone that you\u2019d like. She\u2019s quite open. She\u2019s quite honest \u2015 sometimes to her detriment. She doesn\u2019t necessarily always think things through before saying them. But I don\u2019t do that very well either, so maybe that\u2019s why I related to her. But yeah, she\u2019s quite witty and quite intelligent and very human and driven by her gut and the way she feels about things, which is something that I really liked.\n\nDo we know how old she is or where she was born?\n\nI mean, she\u2019s about early 20s, I would say. Yeah, that kind of age. Aaand I don\u2019t know if I can say where she\u2019s born. In the U.K.! To be vague.\n\nBBC America\n\nWell, obviously the entire \u201cDoctor Who\u201d universe is filled with a ton of secrecy and a lot of these really really dedicated fans. I saw that kids are already dressing up as your character online. What has your life as a companion been like so far \u2015 even before the show has aired?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s been kind of a whirlwind. It\u2019s sort of like being welcomed into like the biggest, most enthusiastic family at a family gathering and being introduced to them all at the same time. And, you know, everyone\u2019s got really strong opinions about what it is you\u2019re about to do, which can be a little bit overwhelming at times. But I think, for me, it\u2019s been amazing. It\u2019s such a wonderful thing to be part of a show that means so much to so many people. You know, people relate to \u201cDoctor Who\u201d in such a personal way, which I think is why people have their own personal favorite Doctor, their favorite companion, their favorite monsters, their favorite episodes. It\u2019s a very strong relationship for a lot of people. And it\u2019s been wonderful to be to be welcomed so wholeheartedly into it.\n\nDid you do any particular research before you took on the role? Did you brush up on any of the history or any of the fan theories?\n\nYou know, I didn\u2019t watch much of \u201cDoctor Who\u201d when I was a kid. I didn\u2019t watch any of the feature series \u2015 I think I\u2019ve watched one episode. But obviously you\u2019d have to be living in some type of a hole to not be aware of the show. After getting the job, I said to Steven and [executive producer] Brian [Minchin], \u201cLook, give me the back catalog and let me watch everything.\u201d And they said, \u201cWell, what you\u2019re doing at the moment is great. You\u2019re bringing a really nice sort of freshness to it. And, you know, you experiencing things as Bill is kind of experiencing things seemed to work really well. So don\u2019t watch it!\u201d\n\nAnd also, I kind of felt like as an actor watching someone play what is essentially your role [as a companion] and watching them do it so well, it would be hard not to borrow a little bit here and there, even subconsciously. And I really didn\u2019t want to do that because I thought Bill was supposed to be completely fresh and completely new to this. So I thought it was best not to [watch].\n\nDid Peter Capaldi or some of the other cast and crew members give you any memorable advice during your first moments on set?\n\nPeter was great. He gave me a little card and a scented candle for my new flat in Cardiff. It was really sweet. It\u2019s such a big beast of a show, you know, in terms of its its reach and its fan base and all the extra little bits that make up the world of Doctor Who. But he said, \u201cRemember why you\u2019re here. You\u2019re here because you\u2019re really good.\u201d Which was very kind of him to say. \u201cThe acting is what you\u2019re here to do \u2015 that\u2019s the main job. We\u2019re here to create this show and everything else is on top. But all of that can be a bit too much sometimes. It can seem like a lot, but if it does, here\u2019s my number. Feel free to have a chat with me about it if anything seems too overwhelming.\u201d Which was very lovely.\n\nThe trailer for the upcoming \u201cWho\u201d season contains the line, \u201c2017 needs us.\u201d And Peter Capaldi has hinted in interview that while Season 9 began to reflect on the modern world a bit more, he thinks we might see more of that in Season 10. Does this mean we\u2019re going to hear about contemporary politics at all on the show?\n\nUmmm, there might be some areas of contemporary politics in this series. Yes, indeed. But not in a very direct way. In a way that is open to interpretation, as all good art that imitates life is. If you know what I mean? Am I being too abstract?\n\nBBC America\n\nI can\u2019t imagine keeping secrets, so I applaud you. On to the next question! One of my favorite \u201cDoctor Who\u201d fan theories claims that the Doctor always regenerates into a face he\u2019s seen before. So, is there any chance the character of Bill is just one giant teaser for your eventual takeover as the Doctor? Would you turn down the role?\n\nWhat, would I turn down the role of Doctor Who? No, I\u2019d be mad to do that, wouldn\u2019t I? Can you imagine if someone was like, \u201cDo you want to be Doctor Who?\u201d And you were like, \u201cNah, I\u2019m alright. One of the most exciting jobs in television? Nah, you can leave that, actually. I\u2019m over it.\u201d That\u2019s not to say that\u2019s what is going to happen. I mean, who knows?\n\nThere\u2019s been loads of discussion about the all-male Doctor roster \u2015 we\u2019ve yet to see a woman tackle the role. What do you make of the show\u2019s track record with representation?\n\nI think in terms of representation, this series is doing pretty well from what I\u2019ve seen so far. Hopefully, by the end of the series, we might have another conversation, or you might think the same. But in terms of playing the character of Doctor Who next, hopefully, they get whoever is best for the job, whatever gender or race that may be.\n\nYou mentioned in a Guardian interview that you didn\u2019t see many people who looked like you on TV growing up. When you think about your role on this show, are you thinking about the fans today who might still feel the same way you did?\n\nI think as an actress of color, there\u2019s always that kind of responsibility. And especially in a prime-time, widely reaching show. For me, if even a couple of kids can look at Bill on \u201cDoctor Who\u201d and think, hey, she looks like me, maybe that means there\u2019s more room for me in the world of acting or the world of television or the world of fighting aliens, then that\u2019s a good thing, you know? I think it is important to see people that look like you and to show that there is a place for you in the world. That you do exist and that you are important. But then, that said, you know, I am only playing one person and she\u2019s not supposed to be representative of every person and every young woman of color, because that would be a generalization that we wouldn\u2019t want to make either.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58500fab1800002c00e42599.jpeg?ops=434_244%2Cquality_75",
