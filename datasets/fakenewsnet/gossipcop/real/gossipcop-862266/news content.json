And, if you\u2019re anything like us, you\u2019re wondering how the heck they managed to make the young Daya look so much like Dascha Polanco during her flashback episode.\n\nThere were more than a few surprises when OITNB returned to Netflix earlier this month, including the reappearance of this beloved character, how our opinions changed about Piscatella, or the insurmountable number of questions that we have following that game-changing season finale.\n\nOne of the surprises that we had during Season 5 was just how similar the young Daya looked to her modern counterpart, played by Dascha Polanco.\n\nDuring the eighth episode of the season, we got even more insight into Daya\u2019s relationship with her mother, Aleida, played by Elizabeth Rodriguez. The flashback gave us a peek at 14-year-old Daya, and goodness the resemblance to Polanco was uncanny.\n\nHowever, some clever internet sleuths put on their detective hats and fired up their little grey cells (or, you know, google) in an attempt to figure out whether the resemblance could be a familial one. After some digging, a Twitter user discovered that the actor who played the young Daya is, in fact, Polanco\u2019s 15-year-old daughter, Dasany Kristal Gonzalez! false\n\nMIND. BLOWN.\n\nWhile Dascha might not look old enough to have a 15-year-old daughter, she does. The 34-year-old actor gave birth to her daughter when she was 18 years old. In fact, as E! News points out, Polanco has previously spoken about her daughter in Latina magazine, describing her as a \u201cmiracle baby.\u201d\n\nWhile we thought there might be some relation between the two when we saw the scene, we still can\u2019t quite get over just how much they look alike.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F02%2F09%2FSwimsuits.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Fyuliya-kosolapova-bqirdOGHvYQ-unsplash-e1573767747444.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/misc/300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F07%2F08%2Fchiron-retrograde-2021.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=600&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F06%2F21%2FDaya.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fdream_about_ex.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F06%2F08%2Ffriendquestions-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F17%2Fboob-sweat.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F20%2Fsex-anxiety-tout.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=600&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F06%2F21%2FDaya.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alim Kheraj", "Updated Jun"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/heres-reason-young-daya-looked-much-like-dascha-polanco-orange-new-black/", "title": "Here's the reason why the young Daya looks so much like Dascha Polanco in \"Orange Is the New Black\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Family,kids,tv", "news_keywords": "Family,kids,tv", "description": "There's a really simple but surprising reason why young Daya and Daya in prison look so similar.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Here's the reason why the young Daya looks so much like Dascha Polanco in \"Orange Is the New Black\"", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/heres-reason-young-daya-looked-much-like-dascha-polanco-orange-new-black/", "description": "There's a really simple but surprising reason why young Daya and Daya in prison look so similar.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=600&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F06%2F21%2FDaya.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/heres-reason-young-daya-looked-much-like-dascha-polanco-orange-new-black/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F06%2F21%2FDaya.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/heres-reason-young-daya-looked-much-like-dascha-polanco-orange-new-black/", "title": "Here's the reason why the young Daya looks so much like Dascha Polanco in \"Orange Is the New Black\"", "description": "There's a really simple but surprising reason why young Daya and Daya in prison look so similar.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=600&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F06%2F21%2FDaya.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/heres-reason-young-daya-looked-much-like-dascha-polanco-orange-new-black/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
