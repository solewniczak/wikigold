Oswalt, 49, recalled, \u201cShe always said, \u2018I don\u2019t care about credit. I want to know that he\u2019s in jail.\u2019 And now he\u2019s caught, the bracelets are on and it feels like this thing that she wanted so badly is now done. It just feels amazing.\u201d\n\nThe Golden State Killer \u2014 dubbed as such by McNamara \u2014 was allegedly linked by DNA and method to 12 murders, 45 sexual assaults and more than 120 burglaries from Sacramento to southern California\u2019s Orange County between 1976 and 1986 in California.\n\n\u2022 Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?
