Anderson, who was at Markle's side when she made her public debut at Harry's Invcitus Games in Toronto, ensured everything was perfect for Markle's shower.\n\nEnjoying the exclusive spa treatments and food with Markle was Lindsay Roth, Markle's best friend from their undergraduate days at Northwestern University. Markle served as Roth's maid of honor at her 2016 wedding in New York.\n\nHeather Dorak, a Pilates entrepreneur and old California friend whom Markle has credited for her toned physique, flew in from the U.S. for the celebration. Markle spent time with Dorak last Christmas after her relationship with Harry went public.\n\nMissing from the celebration was Jessica Mulroney, her stylist and constant companion from Toronto who is assisting Markle in wedding planning. Mulroney did attend Markle's baptism earlier this month, as well as the dinner afterwards hosted by Harry's father, Prince Charles, and stepmother, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nAlso missing was Doria Ragland, Markle's mom. Ragland, who lives in California, is expected soon in London as Markle puts the finishing touches on her May 19 wedding at Windsor Castle.\n\nSoho Farmhouse, in the English countryside, has a special place in Markle's heart. Not only have she and Harry spent quiet private weekends there away from the long lens of the paparazzi, she\u2019s also previously enjoyed girls' trips there.\n\nThe 100-acre property includes 40 cabins, a seven-bedroom farmhouse and a four-bedroom cottage, according to its website.\n\nThe club features a pool, cycling classes, gym equipment, bicycles to explore the famed Oxfordshire countryside and a barn-themed kitchen and restaurant, as well as a traditional English pub with cozy couches, overstuffed chairs and candlelit tables.\n\nThe Soho Farmhouse Cowshed Spa boasts every kind of treatment imaginable, from manicures and pedicures to facials, massages, mud treatments, body scrubs and reflexology.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/meghan-markle-prince-harry1-gty-mem-180314_16x9_992.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/meghan-markle-prince-harry1-gty-mem-180314_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Katie Kindelan", "Carolyn Durand", "March"], "canonical_link": "https://goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/meghan-markles-spa-themed-bridal-shower-53738545", "title": "All about Meghan Markle's spa-themed bridal shower", "meta_data": {"keywords": "meghan markle, wedding, soho farmhouse, prince harry, royals, bachelorette, hen", "copyright": "2022 ABC News Internet Ventures.
