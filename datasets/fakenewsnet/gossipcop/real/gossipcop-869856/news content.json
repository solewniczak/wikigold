Item Off of Their Wedding To-Do List\n\nBring on the cake!\n\nTeen Mom 2 star Jenelle Evans and her fianc\u00e9 David Eason have been busily planning their wedding, but they got a little respite on Thursday when they embarked on a cake tasting.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cHad our cake tasting today!\u201d Evans, 25, wrote in the caption of the photo she posted on Instagram. \u201c#WeddingCake #September #SaveTheDate @easondavid88 (excuse my face, no makeup).\u201d\n\nIn the photo, Evans and Eason sit side-by-side in front of a white platter, which has a variation of cake flavors and frostings for the couple to try.\n\nThe mother of three recently released her memoir Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom in which she describes Eason as being \u201cso different from the other men I had been with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI finally snagged a good man,\u201d she writes.\n\nThe couple announced their engagement in February and revealed their Sept. 23 wedding date this past July with a romantic Instagram photo captioned: \u201cI\u2019m ready to make my life forever with you.\u201d\n\nEason is the father of Evans\u2019 third child, 6-month-old daughter Ensley. She also has two sons from previous relationships: Jace, 7, with ex Andrew Lewis, and Kaiser, 2, with ex-fianc\u00e9 Nathan Griffith.\n\nWhen the MTV star recently went wedding dress shopping, her mother was noticeably absent.\n\nBarbara Evans told PEOPLE she has been left off the guest list for her daughter\u2019s upcoming wedding.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been saying she\u2019s having her wedding, running around with her family of friends, but you know what she says? \u2018My mother Barbara is not invited,\u2019 \u201d the 64-year-old said. \u201cShe\u2019s not inviting me to her own wedding. It\u2019s very painful.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fjenelle-evans2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fjenelle-evans-david.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fjenelle-evans2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexia Fern\u00e1ndez", "July"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/jenelle-evans-david-eason-wedding-cake-tasting/", "title": "Jenelle Evans and David Eason Go Wedding Cake Tasting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Jenelle Evans,News,Teen Mom,Weddings", "news_keywords": "Jenelle Evans,News,Teen Mom,Weddings", "description": "The two have been busy planning their wedding but got a brief respite on Thursday", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Jenelle Evans and David Eason Go Wedding Cake Tasting", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/jenelle-evans-david-eason-wedding-cake-tasting/", "description": "The two have been busy planning their wedding but got a brief respite on Thursday", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fjenelle-evans2.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/jenelle-evans-david-eason-wedding-cake-tasting/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fjenelle-evans2.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/jenelle-evans-david-eason-wedding-cake-tasting/", "title": "Jenelle Evans and David Eason Go Wedding Cake Tasting", "description": "The two have been busy planning their wedding but got a brief respite on Thursday", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fjenelle-evans2.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/jenelle-evans-david-eason-wedding-cake-tasting/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
