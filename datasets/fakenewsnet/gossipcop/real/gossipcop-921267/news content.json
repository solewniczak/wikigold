Someone who\u2019s OK with people seeing her bad sides.\u201d\n\nalicia-vikander-2 Alicia Vikander. | Credit: Thomas Whiteside\n\nVikander said it was also important to her that the action sequences seem believable. \u201cWe wanted to base most of the action in reality,\u201d she explained to Marie Claire.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a girl my size having to become a survivor and overcome a lot of obstacles, and I wanted it to be believable that she could do it,\u201d she added to Marie Claire. \u201cAll the action scenes when I had to fight with a man bigger than me \u2013 we had to figure out how I could actually kick his ass. I wanted to show young girls that it\u2019s cool to be a girl who\u2019s really strong.\u201d\n\nBecoming that physically strong role model took some effort. When she first signed on for Tomb Raider, she told PEOPLE she \u201ccouldn\u2019t do a pull up.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1282&h=641&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Falicia-vikander-1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Falicia-vikander-1-1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Falicia-vikander-2-1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1282&h=641&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Falicia-vikander-1-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Miller", "March"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/alicia-vikander-shares-details-surprise-bachelorette-party-friends-kidnapped-me/", "title": "Alicia Vikander Shares Details on Her Surprise Bachelorette Party: Friends 'Kidnapped Me!'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Alicia Vikander,Michael Fassbender,News", "news_keywords": "Alicia Vikander,Michael Fassbender,News", "description": "\"They kidnapped me for 24 hours!\" Vikander revealed.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Alicia Vikander Shares Details on Her Surprise Bachelorette Party: Friends 'Kidnapped Me!'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/alicia-vikander-shares-details-surprise-bachelorette-party-friends-kidnapped-me/", "description": "\"They kidnapped me for 24 hours!\" Vikander revealed.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1282&h=641&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Falicia-vikander-1-1.jpg", "width": 1282, "height": 641}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/movies/alicia-vikander-shares-details-surprise-bachelorette-party-friends-kidnapped-me/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Falicia-vikander-1-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/movies/alicia-vikander-shares-details-surprise-bachelorette-party-friends-kidnapped-me/", "title": "Alicia Vikander Shares Details on Her Surprise Bachelorette Party: Friends 'Kidnapped Me!'", "description": "\"They kidnapped me for 24 hours!\" Vikander revealed.", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1282&h=641&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Falicia-vikander-1-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/movies/alicia-vikander-shares-details-surprise-bachelorette-party-friends-kidnapped-me/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
