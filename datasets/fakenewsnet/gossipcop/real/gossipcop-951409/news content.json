So happy to be part of this team. So honored they trusted me to play Jesus Christ. So amazed to be in such rarefied air.\"\n\nThere are actually a total of 14 other EGOT recipients, including Audrey Hepburn, Scott Rudin, Mel Brooks. Two of these, Whoopi Goldberg and songwriter Robert Lopez, have won a daytime Emmy.\n\nLegend's wife and supreme social media queen Chrissy Teigen posted a photo of the three \"EGOT GOATS\" on Twitter:\n\nNow, we're just waiting for Teigen's dad's response.\n\nWant to tune in for the big night? The 70th Primetime Emmy Awards will air on Sept. 17 at 5 p.m. PT on NBC.", "images": ["https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/videos/05TuUIXlVbKMlHP4CQpnZA1/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1647340735.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/videos/05TuUIXlVbKMlHP4CQpnZA1/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1647340735.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00WHJtbCixuaKm3nZd0tRKE/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1647280044.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/videos/03ME5xsHbe3DzWQnF0TvKQr/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1647243989.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06rQ2AGLr5cl4wm6lFNwidE/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1643909634.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00c35ddHD9FfjYru335EVJ5/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1647030059.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03JK13uBpKpbLwYiFGRZmbN/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1646911250.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/videos/03ME5xsHbe3DzWQnF0TvKQr/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1647243989.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00WHJtbCixuaKm3nZd0tRKE/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1647280044.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07FQEJNI9PciKQim0lt96LM/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1623372786.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00c35ddHD9FfjYru335EVJ5/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1647030059.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07FQEJNI9PciKQim0lt96LM/hero-image.fill.size_1248x702.v1623372786.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01IMNGoslEWXAUqolu6PteT/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1647265183.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04E0SnTSDYYe1rWdr7kbBZ5/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1647202110.jpg", "https://c.evidon.com/pub/icong1.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05HoBiY7qLj1eoDk7zGNHvc/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1647025546.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04E0SnTSDYYe1rWdr7kbBZ5/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1647202110.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00BAAnC8XVzuXWikhJqhWz7/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1647254956.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06rQ2AGLr5cl4wm6lFNwidE/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1643909634.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01IMNGoslEWXAUqolu6PteT/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1647265183.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00BAAnC8XVzuXWikhJqhWz7/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1647254956.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05HoBiY7qLj1eoDk7zGNHvc/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1647025546.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/03JK13uBpKpbLwYiFGRZmbN/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1646911250.jpg"], "top_img": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07FQEJNI9PciKQim0lt96LM/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1623372786.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://mashable.com/article/john-legend-egot-emmys-2018", "title": "John Legend is the youngest ever to achieve EGOT status", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#00aeef", "application-name": "Mashable.com", "description": "John Legend, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Tim Rice achieved EGOT status at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards in Los Angeles for producing 'Jesus Christ Superstar.'", "fb": {"app_id": 122071082108, "pages": 18807449704}, "og": {"site_name": "Mashable", "title": "John Legend is the youngest ever to achieve EGOT status", "url": "https://mashable.com/article/john-legend-egot-emmys-2018", "description": "\"So amazed to be in such rarefied air.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07FQEJNI9PciKQim0lt96LM/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1623372786.jpg", "secure_url": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07FQEJNI9PciKQim0lt96LM/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1623372786.jpg", "height": 675, "width": 1200}, "type": "article", "article": {"tag": "Music"}}, "article": {"author": "Shannon Connellan", "modified_time": "2021-10-29T15:36:15+00:00", "published_time": "2018-09-10T04:50:49+00:00", "section": "Entertainment"}, "twitter": {"site": "@mashable", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mashable", "title": "John Legend is the youngest ever to achieve EGOT status", "description": "\"So amazed to be in such rarefied air.\""}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1536555049.0, "source": "https://mashable.com", "summary": ""}
