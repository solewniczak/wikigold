Owusu-Breen writes the original show and characters \u201ccan\u2019t be replaced.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is only one Buffy,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut here we are, twenty years later\u2026 And the world seems a lot scarier. So maybe, it could be time to meet a new Slayer.\u201d\n\nThe new Buffy version is being described as a \u201ccontemporary\u201d and \u201crichly diverse\u201d take on the original series, building on the mythology of the original and using aspects of it to comment on aspects of the current political and cultural climates.
