In my head, I sound amazing and then I turn around and her eyes are completely glazed over. I have no idea.

My dad was an insurance salesman,\u201d she says. \u201cMy brother and I rode bikes to school and played in the woods all day. Lots of rescuing animals, tree climbing, sports, gymnastics. I had a good childhood.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

My parents obviously did not believe in that and I worked out okay. I always tell Willow, \u2018I\u2019m going to teach you the rules so that you\u2019ll know how and when to break them.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWatch the full episode of People Cover Story: Pink \u2013 How I\u2019m Raising Strong Kids, streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\nThe singer also strives to create a gender-neutral environment for her brood. \u201cAbsolutely. [But] I feel like gender-neutral is in itself a label and I\u2019m label-less,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t like labels at all so I believe that a woman and a girl can do anything.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Beautiful Issue Cover Star Pink Gets Candid About Her Marriage & How She Takes on the Haters\n\nMore than anything, Pink says she believes in \u201cfairness and justice. And I believe that a boy can do anything. So I have boys that flip dirt bikes and I have boy friends that wear dresses. It\u2019s all okay to me. It\u2019s whatever floats your boat. So that\u2019s the kind of house that we live in.\u201d\n\nFor more from our Beautiful issue, pick up the magazine when it hits newsstands on Friday and check out all of our coverage on PEOPLE.com.\n\ncover Credit: Peggy Sirota\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Pink Gives Daughter Willow Touching and Empowering Dating Advice After 6-Year-Old Asks About Boys\n\n\n\nAs for her children\u2019s future, Pink is more concerned with \u201cjust the world that we live in,\u201d she says. \u201cI have so many worries and fears as a parent. I\u2019m such a worrier. They\u2019re going to be fine. They chose this family. They know what they\u2019re doing. But the world, I don\u2019t know if the world\u2019s going to be fine, and so I pray a lot. I cry a lot. I talk to them a lot. I hope a lot. I curse a lot.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fpink12-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Fcover1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1418&h=709&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fpinkcover.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1418&h=709&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fpinkcover.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Jordan", "April"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/pink-daughter-son-people-beautiful-issue-cover/", "title": "Grammy Winner Pink Graces the Cover of PEOPLE's Beautiful Issue with Her Two Kids", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Carey Hart,Exclusive,Kids,News,Pink,Rollout,The Beautiful Issue,World's Most Beautiful", "news_keywords": "Carey Hart,Exclusive,Kids,News,Pink,Rollout,The Beautiful Issue,World's Most Beautiful", "description": "Singer Pink opens up about the challenges and joys of motherhood - and how she's raising her children to be strong", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Grammy Winner Pink Graces the Cover of PEOPLE's Beautiful Issue with Her Two Kids", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/pink-daughter-son-people-beautiful-issue-cover/", "description": "Singer Pink opens up about the challenges and joys of motherhood - and how she's raising her children to be strong", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1418&h=709&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fpinkcover.jpg", "width": 1418, "height": 709}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/parents/pink-daughter-son-people-beautiful-issue-cover/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fpinkcover.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/parents/pink-daughter-son-people-beautiful-issue-cover/", "title": "Grammy Winner Pink Graces the Cover of PEOPLE's Beautiful Issue with Her Two Kids", "description": "Singer Pink opens up about the challenges and joys of motherhood - and how she's raising her children to be strong", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1418&h=709&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fpinkcover.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/parents/pink-daughter-son-people-beautiful-issue-cover/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
