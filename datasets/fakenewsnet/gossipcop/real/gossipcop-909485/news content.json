If Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez are still together today, they would be celebrating their 10-year anniversary tonight on New Year's Eve!\n\nAs MTV News reports, the two characters met during winter break at a ski lodge, where they wound up singing a karaoke duet, \"Start of Something New.\" (The movie technically hit theaters on January 20, 2006, but the story began on December 31, 2005.)\n\nAfter the song ended, the clock struck midnight, and Troy and Gabriella thought they would never see each other again... that is, until Gabriella happened to move to Troy's high school! You know how the rest of the story goes, of course: they end up dating by the end of the first movie, break up in the second, and reunite and enroll in nearby colleges so they can be together in the third movie. Awww!\n\nTroy and Gabriella would be 26 or 27 years old today, which is seriously MIND-BLOWING.\n\nIn real life, Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens met on the set of High School Musical in 2005, began dating some time after, and broke up in 2010. Both actors are happily coupled up with other people now: Zac began dating model and entrepreneur Sami Mir\u00f3 last year, and Vanessa has been with actor Austin Butler since 2011.\n\nEven if IRL Troyella was unfortunately not meant to be, we can't stop wondering if Troy and Gabriella would be celebrating their anniversary with a New Year's Eve midnight kiss tonight!", "images":
