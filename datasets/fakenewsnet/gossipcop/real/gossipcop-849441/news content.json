The U.K. publication ran photos of the pairing riding around in Styles\u2019 car over the weekend and reports that the singer, 23, has already introduced Ward to some of his friends. \u201cAs soon as Harry met Tess there was an instant spark between them,\u201d claims The Sun. \u201cThey really bonded over their mutual love of quirky fashion and food \u2013 and things turned romantic quickly.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick briefing on the stunning blonde.\n\n1. She started as a model\n\nWard, 27, told U.K. magazine Phoenix that she first started modeling at age 19. \u201cI did it briefly but it didn\u2019t really completely sing to my heart so I decided to take a break from it for a while,\u201d she said. Though she\u2019s transitioned into the food world, the blogger clearly still shows an interest in the fashion industry, displaying her chic style on Instagram. Some of her go-to wardrobe essentials? \u201cLeather trousers and oversized jumpers,\u201d she said. \u201cExactly the same thing for day and night, with a good bit of bling and a pair of heels thrown in.\u201d\n\n2. She\u2019s got serious foodie credentials\n\nAccording to her website, Ward trained at the prestigious culinary school Le Cordon Bleu. (Mario Batali, Giada De Laurentiis and Julia Child all studied there.) And that\u2019s not her only degree. \u201cI am also am a certified health coach,\u201d she writes of her diploma from the Institute for Integrative Nutrition. Ward has put her education to good use by cooking in the kitchen at The Ritz Hotel and hosting \u201cVIP dinners\u201d for high-end fashion brands.\n\n3. She\u2019s already got a cookbook under her belt\n\nWard released her first cookbook, The Naked Diet, in 2015. It gets its name from \u201cdelicious dishes, stripped back to their barest essentials, for simple everyday cooking,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe recipes are a mix of healthful and creating [sic], including contemporary takes on favourites and unique twists.\u201d Inside, readers can find dishes like her beetroot quinoa granola, lamb meatballs with spiced rhubarb sauce and pistachios, super green cauliflower couscous and soba noodles with mango and sesame.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Try Our Amazing Never Watered Down Bloody Mary\n\n4. She\u2019s an avid traveler\n\nOne look at her Instagram and you can tell Ward doesn\u2019t like to sit in one place for too long. Some of her recent trips include Mexico, New York City, and India. Regardless of her location though, all of her trips are beautifully documented through food porn, selfies and snippets into the city\u2019s culture.\n\n5.
