We\u2019ve broken her style down for you here so you can get your wardrobe one step closer to celebrity status. (Don\u2019t worry\u2026 you\u2019ll get used to the flash bulbs.)\n\nLess is More\n\nJennifer knows what works for her and she repeats styles and colors across different looks. Her pallet is neutral which allows for a lot of versatility with her pieces.\n\nKnow When to Tuck\n\nAs we\u2019ve emphasized in our blog post, How to Tuck in Your Shirt, the right tuck can make or break your outfit. Jennifer utilizes the simple front tuck for an effortless and casual vibe and the full tuck to create a refined and sophisticated look.\n\nAccessorize to Maximize Style\n\nThe right accessories take a simple look from basic and boring to stylish and chic. What\u2019s great about starting with a simple base is that it allows for a variety of accessories from simple to statement, and it also allows you to showcase your individual style.\n\nDo the Unexpected\n\nWhile Jennifer\u2019s style is mostly simple neutrals, she tends to add in a piece from time to time that is outside of the norm. Keep it interesting by adding a pattern, a pop of color or a statement accessory.\n\nMix it Up\n\nPairing a classic or preppy piece with a fashion-forward or trend piece is something you\u2019ll find throughout Jennifer\u2019s looks. Select a top and accessories that you would typically wear to work with slacks and instead, wear it with destructed denim.\n\nTell your stylist to refine your look or help you create a new one. Create a Front Door Fashion Pinterest board with your favorite styles, celebrities and more to help her get it just right.
