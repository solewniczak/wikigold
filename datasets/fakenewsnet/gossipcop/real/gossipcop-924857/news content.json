Credit: ABC\n\nKimmel naturally had to make a few funny comments about the situation. \u201cI feel like I ran into you at the spa, like we\u2019re at a destination wedding together and you went to get a massage and I\u2019m waiting to get a massage and you came out and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh hey how\u2019s it going?\u2019 and it\u2019s a little bit weird,\u201d he joked.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1400&h=700&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fjenna-tout.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fjenna-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fkimmel-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1400&h=700&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fjenna-tout.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colleen Kratofil", "April"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/jenna-fischer-wears-towel-jimmy-kimmel-live/", "title": "Jenna Fischer Wears a Bath Towel on Jimmy Kimmel Live After Wardrobe Malfunction", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Jenna Fischer,Jimmy Kimmel,Jimmy Kimmel Live,News,Wardrobe Malfunction", "news_keywords": "Jenna Fischer,Jimmy Kimmel,Jimmy Kimmel Live,News,Wardrobe Malfunction", "description": "After a last-minute wardrobe malfunction, Jenna Fischer wore a towel on her segment on Jimmy Kimmel Live", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Jenna Fischer Wears a Bath Towel on Jimmy Kimmel Live After Wardrobe Malfunction", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/jenna-fischer-wears-towel-jimmy-kimmel-live/", "description": "After a last-minute wardrobe malfunction, Jenna Fischer wore a towel on her segment on Jimmy Kimmel Live", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1400&h=700&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fjenna-tout.jpg", "width": 1400, "height": 700}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/style/jenna-fischer-wears-towel-jimmy-kimmel-live/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fjenna-tout.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/style/jenna-fischer-wears-towel-jimmy-kimmel-live/", "title": "Jenna Fischer Wears a Bath Towel on Jimmy Kimmel Live After Wardrobe Malfunction", "description": "After a last-minute wardrobe malfunction, Jenna Fischer wore a towel on her segment on Jimmy Kimmel Live", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1400&h=700&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fjenna-tout.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/style/jenna-fischer-wears-towel-jimmy-kimmel-live/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmO2143BzYA"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
