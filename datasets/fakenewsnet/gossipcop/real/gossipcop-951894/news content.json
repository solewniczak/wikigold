We all\n\nlike gush over him as a family a lot,\" Alba explains.\n\n\n\nThe girls spend a lot of time loving on their baby brother, but at their ages they've also got a\n\nlot going on outside the family, which is why Alba says the age gap worked out so nicely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You know, when they're kids and they're like 7 and 10 they're pretty independent and they have\n\nsleepovers and they do their own thing, so it's nice to have a little baby that needs us,\" she\n\nsays.\n\n\n\nAdding a third child to the mix obviously means that Alba and Warren's time is even more precious\n\nthese days than it was before Hayes' arrival, and the couple has taken steps to make sure that each\n\nof their daughters gets a share of each parent's time.\n\n\"Since we've had him Cash and I have made it a point to spend more one on one time with the girls,\n\nso I'll take one and he'll take one for an afternoon and we'll do a little lunch or go on a hike or\n\nhave a picnic,\" Alba tells Motherly. \"Basically our daughter, whichever one we have, they get to\n\nchoose whatever they want and they have our undivided attention for that three hours. It's been\n\nreally special bonding time. We don't do it every weekend but we try to do it at least once a\n\nmonth. And that's been something the kids have really looked forward to and really liked.\"", "images": ["https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Toys-Collection-450x360.jpeg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ARTICLE-HERO-Viral-News-2022-03-14T120650.381-450x360.png", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/heroshop_1000x-450x360.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ARTICLE-HERO-Viral-News-2022-03-10T100133.246-450x360.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1106024069411107&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cozy-Home-450x360.jpeg", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2214/4069/products/MGTBM_cover_back_large.png?v=1630251512", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-20-450x360.png", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/kids-using-tablet-and-phone-on-sofa-450x360.png", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pregnancy-Shop-450x360.jpeg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Motherly_SOM22_ArticleHero-450x360.jpg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ARTICLE-HERO-Viral-News-2022-03-11T082337.118-450x360.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20360'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20273%20487'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/default-image-450x360.png", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mother-holding-newborn-baby-in-bed-450x360.png", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2214/4069/products/044d16a9a033986ce281d00253cde986_large.png?v=1644508277", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ashley-graham-getting-ready-450x360.png", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/themes/motherly/assets/svg/hero-flower-1.svg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jessica-alba-life-with-3-kids-featured-e1644525528694.jpeg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/playing-family-lifestyle-happy-eco-brother-and-sister-kids-toy-wooden-toy-knitted-basket-eco-friendly_t20_XNVBK6-450x360.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jessica-alba-life-with-3-kids-featured-e1644525528694.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Heather Marcoux"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mother.ly/news/celebrity-news/jessica-alba-life-with-3-kids/", "title": "Real talk with Jessica Alba: Bedtime might be the most challenging part of having 3 kids", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "Jessica Alba also opens up about the perks of her kids' age gap and what she and husband Cash Warren do to help each child feel special.", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Real talk with Jessica Alba: Bedtime might be the most challenging part of having 3 kids - Motherly - Motherly", "description": "Jessica Alba also opens up about the perks of her kids' age gap and what she and husband Cash Warren do to help each child feel special.", "url": "https://www.mother.ly/news/celebrity-news/jessica-alba-life-with-3-kids/", "site_name": "Motherly", "updated_time": "2022-02-10T20:40:39+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jessica-alba-life-with-3-kids-featured-e1644525528694.jpeg", "secure_url": "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jessica-alba-life-with-3-kids-featured-e1644525528694.jpeg", "width": 1440, "height": 1498, "alt": "Jessica Alba", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/motherlymedia", "tag": "Positive Parenting", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-08-03T00:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-02-10T20:40:39+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Real talk with Jessica Alba: Bedtime might be the most challenging part of having 3 kids - Motherly - Motherly", "description": "Jessica Alba also opens up about the perks of her kids' age gap and what she and husband Cash Warren do to help each child feel special.", "site": "@MotherlyMedia", "creator": "@MotherlyMedia", "image": "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jessica-alba-life-with-3-kids-featured-e1644525528694.jpeg", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Heather Marcoux", "label2": "Time to read", "data2": "4 minutes"}, "fb": {"pages": 1595847887360603, "app_id": 407282234107977}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.mother.ly/news/celebrity-news/jessica-alba-life-with-3-kids/?wpna_ia_markup=true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Favicon.svg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533254400.0, "source": "https://www.mother.ly", "summary": ""}
