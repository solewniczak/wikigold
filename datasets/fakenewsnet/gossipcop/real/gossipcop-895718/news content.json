The awards show, hosted by \u201cThe Good Place\u201d star Kristen Bell, will take place on Jan. 21.\n\nLIST: The 2018 SAG Award nominees\n\nIn statements to the Los Angeles Times, several nominees repeatedly thanked their drama families, particularly the casts and crews of their respective projects. Here\u2019s what some of them had to say about the recognition:\n\nAlison Brie. (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAlison Brie, \u201cGLOW\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is such a great honor to be recognized by my fellow actors with this nomination. I am so proud to be part of a show that celebrates the craft of acting, with all its pitfalls and glories, and to be able to work with such a diverse group of insanely talented women. \u2018GLOW\u2019 has meant the world to me and I\u2019m deeply thankful for this recognition for me and the cast. Thank you SAG-AFTRA!!\u201d\n\nMillie Bobby Brown. (Mark Boster / Los Angeles Times)\n\nMillie Bobby Brown, \u201cStranger Things\u201d\n\n\u201cScreen Actors Guild! Thank you SO much for recognizing me and our cast for the second year in a row! This means the world coming from you, our peers. I am so lucky and honored to have the privilege of playing Eleven \u2014 a strong, powerful, badass, strange, wonderful character! Can\u2019t wait to celebrate with my \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 family!\u201d\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet. (Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times)\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet, \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat an incredible morning! This nomination is very close to my heart because it\u2019s from the actor. When we made \u2018Call Me By Your Name,\u2019 we had no idea what it would turn into. The experience in making the film with Armie [Hammer] was so special, and yet, we just didn\u2019t know. Simply put, I\u2019ve been blown away by the response this film has received. And, to be included in ensemble along with my \u2018Lady Bird\u2019 family (congrats, Saoirse [Ronan]!) makes this recognition that much more special.\u201d\n\nDavid Harbour. (Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times)\n\nDavid Harbour, \u201cStranger Things\u201d\n\n\u201dIf it isn\u2019t wildly apparent by now, I\u2019ll say it directly \u2014 I love actors! To be recognized by my peers in such distinguished company gives me a special joy. And Millie [Bobby Brown] and the show! Beyond.\n\n\u201cWhen I act, when I create, I feel alive, full to bursting, and I feel of service to the mysterious goodness that firmly exists in this world. I have been rewarded with a life that indulges in the primacy of self, but at its core and at its purest and its best, it is a life of service. A service to audiences. To prod and poke when necessary, to comfort and entertain when times seem dark, to ever expand the human experience, to offer a reason to live, to celebrate to the gods the great gift and scourge that is consciousness. Sometimes it means expressing iron intellect and rigorous truth that bonds us all in the achingly profound wisdom of no escape. Sometimes it means revealing the intimate moments of endurance, of unexpected kindness, unasked for love. And sometimes it simply means making a fierce and joyful noise, to spin, to twirl, to throw your hands up with the relentless dips and climb aboard this roller coaster of life. Ya know, to dance. *insert Hopper dancing gif*\n\n\u201cThank you for recognizing me, as it might mean it\u2019ll be easier to get more jobs doing it.\u201d\n\nSally Hawkins, \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d\n\n\u201cI am beyond thrilled to have received the honor of this nomination. And to receive it from fellow colleagues is huge to me. Guillermo [del Toro], this film and the entire cast and crew hold a very special place in my heart and always will. Each and every one of them made me better. I am truly delighted more than I can really express in words but my heart is fit to burst with pride for us all. Thank you dearest SAG members. Thank you for your embrace.\u201d\n\nSean Hayes. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)\n\nSean Hayes, \u201cWill & Grace\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so honored to be recognized in this category with these extraordinary actors. I love acting because I love actors. I also like to bake sometimes.\u201d\n\nRichard Jenkins. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)\n\nRichard Jenkins, \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201c\n\n\u201cI am thrilled and humbled to be nominated by my peers for a SAG Award. This union is very close to my heart. Well, the SAG card is in my wallet, so it\u2019s a little further south.\u201d\n\nZoe Kazan. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)\n\nZoe Kazan, \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you to SAG for honoring \u2018The Big Sick\u2019 ensemble with a nomination. It means so much to us, especially from our acting peers. I am deeply proud to be a part of this film and to have brought Kumail [Nanjiani] and Emily [V. Gordon]\u2019s story into the world, especially at this time. We are particularly moved to have been recognized as an ensemble, as this was such an extraordinary collaborative experience I\u2019m excited to be reunited once more with my movie family, and to share this with Kumail, Holly [Hunter], Ray [Romano], Zenobia [Shroff], Anupam [Kher], and Adeel [Akhtar]\u2014 and everyone else who helped bring \u2018The Big Sick\u2019 to life.\u201d\n\nNicole Kidman. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)\n\nNicole Kidman, \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat an amazing morning! Thank you to SAG-AFTRA for recognizing \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 in such a significant way. I\u2019ve been acting since I was 14 and have dedicated an enormous amount of my life to my craft so to be acknowledged by my acting family is the most incredible honor.\u201d\n\nJason Bateman and Laura Linney. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)\n\nLaura Linney, \u201cOzark\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so proud to be included in a list of such wonderful actresses who have raised the bar so high. What an amazing year for women in television. And I am especially proud to be representing \u2018Ozark\u2019 with my TV spouse, the ever deserving Jason Bateman! Thank you SAG-AFTRA!\u201d\n\nMarc Maron. (Lawrence K. Ho / Los Angeles Times)\n\nMarc Maron, \u201cGLOW\u201d\n\n\u201cI am stunned and excited to be recognized by other actors in this way. I really never thought this was possible in my life. It helps to be surrounded by amazing actors and to have such a defined and well written character as Sam Sylvia and to be on a show as unique as \u2018GLOW.\u2019 I am just a small part. So, thanks SAG for recognizing me and the mind-blowing ensemble that is \u2018GLOW.\u2019\u201d\n\nKumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon. (Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times)\n\nKumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon, \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are so lucky to have been graced with the enormous talents of every single member of our cast. They each put a piece of themselves into our story and we are thrilled at being recognized. Thank you. And a special shout out to Holly Hunter\u2019s individual nomination!\n\n\u201cNow we have to go tell our real parents that they aren\u2019t actually nominated.\u201d\n\nBob Odenkirk. (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBob Odenkirk, \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to get this nomination from my fellow actors! At \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 I am surrounded by an ensemble of excellence \u2014 Michael McKean, Rhea Seehorn, Jonathan Banks, everybody raises my game. Thank you to SAG-AFTRA.\u201d\n\nGary Oldman. (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times)\n\nGary Oldman, \u201cThe Darkest Hour\u201d\n\n\u201cNo actor could ever deny the special satisfaction that comes from being recognized by your fellow artists \u2026 we all share the same challenges, insecurities, and uncertainties, chief among them, the question \u2018am I any good?\u2019\u2026 this nomination, and in the wonderful company of the other nominees, is so very satisfying.\u201d\n\nMargot Robbie. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)\n\nMargot Robbie, \u201cI, Tonya\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so incredibly moved and excited to be nominated by my fellow actors. I feel very fortunate to be able to have had the opportunity to bring Tonya\u2019s story to the big screen. Thank you to Steven [Rogers] for his brilliant and unique script, to Allison [Janney] and Sebastian [Stan] for being such incredible screen partners and to Craig [Gillespie] for his amazing direction and perfectly capturing the tone and essence of the film.
