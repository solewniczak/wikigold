The acclaimed Hulu series, which began streaming on Hulu in May, received eight awards from 13 nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series.\n\nAfter the show, E! News' Zuri Hall caught up with the cast and crew backstage, where Moss (modeling a a Prabal Gurung dress) confessed she \"blacked out\" after beating the likes of Viola Davis (\"How to Get Away With Murder\"), Claire Foy (\"The Crown\"), Keri Russell (\"The Americans\"), Evan Rachel Wood (\"Westworld\") and Robin Wright (\"House of Cards\").\n\n\"I really did. I don't really remember much of it. I've never experienced them actually calling my name, so it was a very strange feeling,\" said Moss, who received five nominations between 2009 and 2015 for her work on \"Mad Men.\" Finally winning was an \"incredible\" feeling, she added. \"It's like an out of body experience \u2014 and then you immediately try to remember everybody you have to thank.\"\n\nEmmy Awards 2017 Winners\n\n\n\nFellow Emmy winner Donald Glover had the exact same reaction to his Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series as Moss did when she won. \"I blacked out,\" he told Hall as well. \"I was not ready for that.\"\n\nAt the end of her acceptance speech, Moss thanked her mom, calling her a \"f---ing badass.\" Since CBS censored her, is there anything else she wanted to say? \"No,\" she said. \"I crushed it!\"\n\nMoss then handed one of the two Emmys in her hands to Bledel, who called her own recognition at last week's ceremony \"amazing\" and \"so exciting.\" More than anything, the actress said, \"I'm just so proud to get to do this work. To have an Emmy...I just can't believe it.\"", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2019/09/Philadelphia_On_Light@3x-3.png?fit=519%2C120&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/03/AP_22074567899517.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=600%2C338", "https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-5.png?fit=1024%2C576&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2022/03/107024541-1646324471412-gettyimages-1238900788-AFP_324E69M-e1647420325143.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=600%2C338", "https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2019/09/Philadelphia_On_Dark@3x-1.png?fit=405%2C120&quality=85&strip=all&w=135&h=40"], "top_img": "https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-5.png?fit=1024%2C576&quality=85&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zach Johnson"], "canonical_link": "http://www.eonline.com/news/880983/elisabeth-moss-blacked-out-when-she-won-an-award-at-the-2017-emmys", "title": "Elisabeth Moss \u2018Blacked Out' When She Won an Award at the 2017 Emmys", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 5.5.9", "og": {"site_name": "NBC10 Philadelphia", "type": "article", "description": "Alexis Bledel also talked to E!
