It's just the way things worked out.\n\n\"When you adopt, you have to do it unconditionally. I threw myself into the adoption process because I was convinced that I could fulfill the role of mother and give my children all the love and attention they need. No one aspires to become a single parent, but I learned a long time ago that you can't control everything in life. I have adapted to the situation because I am pragmatic.\"\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress - who split from Sean Penn last year - also revealed she \"craved\" motherhood before she decided to adopt her children.\n\nShe told Elle Canada: \"Everything has changed! When I became a mother, I had already wanted it for a long time.\n\n(Elle Canada August 2016 cover)\n\n\"I craved motherhood, and I was incredibly invested in it. It's not easy to adopt, even when you're a celebrity. But when I held my children in my arms, I was happier than I ever expected to be. Today, motherhood is a source of joy every single day, something stronger than everything else, more powerful than my career.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Charlize revealed she likes to live in solitude in order to maintain her mental health.\n\nThe Mad Max: Fury Road star said: \"I don't expose myself in my films - I play a role.\n\n\"There is a false and very widespread belief that an actress has to give up her privacy. I don't believe that. I don't reveal some parts of my private life to the public. That's what I need to do to preserve my mental health. I want to be able to come home at night and feel that part of me is still intact, secret.\"", "images": ["https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10095/5690ba4019c4401987c3e8d0c26d4041.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7017/7c27bcfc95b149e3a1e01fa7644d8599.png", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/178/bfbb4f4ed0d041fa8ee7aeb140acc103.jpeg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1558/007fe970b4a343d98d07a7d2c54ec818.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/979/c2b516a30c6b4be3a16a2662b43b87c9.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1128/116df9619a524b08b7c2577bc1748212.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10142/36363d3522844779b5f12f3edab7f73a.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8407/23a1b651dcf346928ef353e5c2eff539.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/957/3ff9f4f18d7b4ed49ea760710f679f20.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/748/f1f21c72d6124b40acd8cc1e8a11233b.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1280/bed85fca502d4c4396da6c72b0bffe7c.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7017/0c69e7f5abab4654a0673d13f24315d4.png", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10142/234605d608f94f1292abd4aa449756b8.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1319/c35c15ab0aa140ac9c5caa773107d5bb.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7017/5b673d720fca42b991d8f6421efed5ea.png", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/180/07caeda8d8c24150bb28ec8cacc5661e.jpeg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10142/edda81dd8c96421184dafa3a9d807c5e.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/182/315935c6fce946e89504ea65708b8211.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10095/162bc878db9b47d1bed7dca554e5574c.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10095/1e5d1bfb48cb4c40919790041ca5889a.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10142/e7210280e24b4cc0bae077af99952962.svg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/748/f1f21c72d6124b40acd8cc1e8a11233b.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.news24.com/Channel/charlize-theron-opens-up-about-being-a-single-mom-20160701", "title": "Charlize Theron opens up about being a single mom", "meta_data": {"mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "News24", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "default", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "red", "msapplication-TileColor": "red", "msapplication-TileImage": "~/images/pwa/news24/mstile-150x150.png", "application-name": "News24", "msapplication-tooltip": "News24.
