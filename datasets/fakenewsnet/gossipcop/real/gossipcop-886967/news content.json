It\u2019s fine. And there are always things you can do to make yourself feel better,\u201d she says. \u201cSpanx exist for a reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to focus on things that are positive \u2014 like, I\u2019ve never had boobs before, so I\u2019m going to try those on for a little bit,\u201d The Hills alum adds. \u201cI\u2019m trying on a new shape.\u201d\n\nThe designer, author and lifestyle expert spills on what she craved during and since pregnancy \u2014 in a nutshell, \u201creally simple foods,\u201d with a few unique caveats.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t eaten red meat since I was 16 and I started eating red meat again. I gave it up for Lent one year and then I went to eat it again and it made me feel sick,\u201d Conrad explains. \u201cAnd for some reason that changed. I had a hamburger for breakfast the other day!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was pregnant, I ate a lot of peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches on sourdough,\u201d she says. \u201cMost nights, we do chicken, rice and salad. We do a lot of stuff on the grill. But for three or four months, I couldn\u2019t do any chicken, so it was kind of hard to figure out what to eat besides that.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor William was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what to feed you!\u2019 I wanted carbs and cheese. William said I ate like I lived in a roller rink. I wanted kid food. That\u2019s all I wanted. Macaroni and cheese.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Former Bachelorette Emily Maynard Johnson Says She Wants 2 More Kids to Up Her Total to 5\n\nConrad says she and Tell will \u201cprobably have two\u201d kids total (\u201cIt\u2019s best not to be outnumbered\u201d), but for now is focused on finding a balance between motherhood and her career \u2014 in fact, she\u2019s already back at work!\n\n\u201cI just emptied my inbox,\u201d she admits. \u201cEverybody is kind of leaving me alone, which is really nice, but I like to be busy. I\u2019m working on my Kohl\u2019s line, selecting prints and quick back-and-forths. And I have a work call today for a spring fitting.\u201d\n\ncover-8-14-2017\n\nBut the working mom has \u201calways balanced both\u201d sides of life, she says: \u201cI think it\u2019s good.
