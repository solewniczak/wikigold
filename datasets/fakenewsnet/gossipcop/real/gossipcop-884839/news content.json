DeGeneres has Winfrey pose for a honeydew melon boob pic, pick out produce, and stand by as she shouts to the other shoppers, \"Oprah's touched all the peaches, everybody! Whoever wants a peach, Oprah's touched them!\" We certainly want one of those peaches. At one point Ellen even gets a hold of the loudspeaker and announces to the store, \"I need a dandruff shampoo for Oprah, if someone could tell me where the dandruff shampoo for Oprah is...\" while Oprah giggles off to the side.", "images": ["https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg", "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/94f/735,0,531,1011/x/1863034/image.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/c5a8ae3dd50e6ebe17044593c2c7ee0c.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a70678be6c693f8a9915bec2fa49ee49.svg"], "top_img": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/94f/735,0,531,1011/x/1863034/image.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mercedes Viera", "Jinnie Lee", "Alexandra Polk", "Brianna Arps", "Elizabeth Buxton", "Cortne Bonilla", "Kate Spencer", "Amanda Randone", "Marshall Bright", "Eliza Dumais"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/10/175344/ellen-degeneres-and-oprah-winfrey-go-grocery-shopping-together", "title": "Ellen & Oprah Tried Cooking Dinner Together & Things Got Weird", "meta_data": {"title": "Ellen DeGeneres And Oprah Winfrey Go Grocery Shopping", "description": "Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey took their first trip to a grocery store together in years \u2014 and of course filmed the shopping hilarity that ensued.", "og": {"url": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/10/175344/ellen-degeneres-and-oprah-winfrey-go-grocery-shopping-together", "title": "Ellen & Oprah Tried Cooking Dinner Together & Things Got Weird", "description": "Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey took their first trip to a grocery store together in years \u2014 and of course filmed the shopping hilarity that ensued.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/94f/735,0,531,1011/x/1863034/image.png", "secure_url": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/94f/735,0,531,1011/x/1863034/image.png", "width": 531, "height": 1011}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Ellen & Oprah Tried Cooking Dinner Together & Things Got Weird", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@refinery29", "description": "Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey took their first trip to a grocery store together in years \u2014 and of course filmed the shopping hilarity that ensued.", "image": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/94f/735,0,531,1011/x/1863034/image.png"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/entry/68b/112,0,1776,2400/x/1862010/image.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 155023867867753, "pages": "86973707921,587074007996399,269626263209765,509115739117952,1562713254009921,583745561686633,656112191237463,284423314989162,974273182666651,192477361634120"}, "article": {"publisher": "refinery29"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#fd5b4e", "news_keywords": "ellen degeneres, oprah winfrey, celebs food shopping, oprah food, the ellen show, ellen and oprah, ellen grocery shopping skit, oprah goes grocery shopping, ellen and oprah go grocery shopping together, where does oprah grocery shop, does oprah grocery shop, does ellen degeneres grocery shop, where do stars grocery shop, videos of stars grocery shopping, ellen show skits, best ellen show celebrity skits, best grocery shopping celebrities, celebs grocery shopping, funny celeb videos, funny ellen videos, funny oprah videos", "p": {"domain_verify": "b10faeb45f92f5ebf0073a215d615ea9"}, "entry_template": "entry.article", "author": "Elizabeth Buxton"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508191200.0, "source": "https://www.refinery29.com", "summary": ""}
