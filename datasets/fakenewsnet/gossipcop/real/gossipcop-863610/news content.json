Her father has inspired her to become a nurse, and so she applied to the Folds of Honor Foundation for one of the scholarships they provide for children and spouses of veterans (with funding help from Budweiser). In a new video from Budweiser, Driver drives out to Brodheadsville, Pennsylvania, to personally deliver the good news to the Williams family that Hayley had won one of the grants.\n\n\u201cI found the Williams to be an incredibly close-knit and loving family,\u201d Driver told the Huffington Post. \u201cI understood where Hayley\u2019s father, John, was coming from right away. John was injured right before being deployed. I was also injured right before deployment, so that sense of not finishing your job with the people you started with is something we connected on. Unfortunately, he is left with limited mobility and over the past 20 years, he has received multiple back surgeries to try to help. Despite his injuries, he works incredibly hard as a bus driver to support his family. Hayley\u2019s father inspired her to become a nurse to help people just like him. \u2026 I felt very fortunate to be there and to help Hayley take the next step.\u201d", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fdriver-3-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2015%2F09%2F11%2FScreen-Shot-2019-11-20-at-11.34.46-AM.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fdriver-3-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fdriver-3-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christian Holub", "June", "At Am Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/06/27/adam-driver-surprises-military-family-scholarship/", "title": "Adam Driver Surprises Military Family With Scholarship", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Adam Driver", "news_keywords": "Adam Driver", "description": "The actor drove out to Pennsylvania to deliver the good news", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Adam Driver Surprises Military Family With Scholarship", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/06/27/adam-driver-surprises-military-family-scholarship/", "description": "The actor drove out to Pennsylvania to deliver the good news", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fdriver-3-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/06/27/adam-driver-surprises-military-family-scholarship/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fdriver-3-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/06/27/adam-driver-surprises-military-family-scholarship/", "title": "Adam Driver Surprises Military Family With Scholarship", "description": "The actor drove out to Pennsylvania to deliver the good news", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fdriver-3-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/06/27/adam-driver-surprises-military-family-scholarship/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/huQrvmrJbXk"], "publish_date": 1498514400.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
