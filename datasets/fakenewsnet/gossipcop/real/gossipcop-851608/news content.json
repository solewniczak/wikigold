The following year, he appeared in an episode of the Australian television medical drama All Saints. Lonsdale became a recurring member of the cast of the Australian teen drama series Dance Academy in the 2012 second season as the character Oliver Lloyd, who became a regular in the third and final season.\n\nLonsdale was a VJ on MTV for two and a half years.[6] He released a single on iTunes titled \"One and Only\" in 2014. He then played a supporting role as Uriah Pedrad in The Divergent Series: Insurgent (2015), the second film in the series,[7] later briefly reprising said role in The Divergent Series: Allegiant (2016). In 2016, his single \"Higher\" was included on Connor Franta's curated album Common Culture, volume 5.[8] Lonsdale next appeared in the historical drama The Finest Hours (2016) as Eldon Hanon, the youngest sailor involved in a rescue at sea.\n\nIn 2015, Lonsdale auditioned for the role of Jefferson Jackson, but the role was given to Franz Drameh.[9] Instead, he was cast as Wally West (the previously unknown son of Joe West) on CW's The Flash and became a regular supporting character in season two and as Kid Flash in season three.[10] In 2017, the character left The Flash and debuted on season three of Legends of Tomorrow.[11] That year, Lonsdale also appeared in an episode of Supergirl.[12]\n\nIn 2018, Lonsdale starred as Bram in the film Love, Simon, based on the novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda by Becky Albertalli about a teenage boy who struggles to come out.
