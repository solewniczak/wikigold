In the image, the happy couple shared a smooch.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cThis Sunday\u2019s outcome is a lot better than last Sunday\u2019s!\u201d Brady joked in the caption. But the 40-year-old athlete clearly still has the Patriots\u2019 defeat at the hands of the Philadelphia Eagles on his mind, adding the hashtag \u201c#losingstreakstopsatone.\u201d\n\nNearly a week after the big game, Brady finally addressed the loss on Instagram, Friday, sharing a photo of himself and teammate Rob Gronkowski along with a message of gratitude to everyone who supported him and his team.\n\n\u201cIt has taken me a few days to reflect on our SB loss as well as the great season our team had,\u201d Brady wrote. \u201cThere are many emotions when you come up short of your goal. And they are all part of learning and growing in this journey of life.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cLearning turns everything into a positive. And the number one feeling I have had the past 4 days is gratitude. Gratitude to my teammates for the incredible effort given all season regardless of the challenges we faced.\u201d\n\nAlthough B\u00fcndchen supported her husband during football\u2019s biggest game, but a source recently told PEOPLE the mother of two, 37,would still like to see him retire.\n\n\u201cGisele always supports Tom no matter what,\u201d a source close to the couple said.\n\ntom-brady

Eagles Fly to Their First-Ever Super Bowl Win in Stunning Victory Against Patriots\n\nB\u00fcndchen extended an olive branch to the Eagles while also praising her husband and his team for their \u201ccommitment\u201d and \u201csacrifice\u201d after the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cCongratulations Eagles for winning the Super Bowl, what a game that was!\u201d she wrote on Instagram.", "images":
