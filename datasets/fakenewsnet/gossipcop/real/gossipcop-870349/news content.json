A practical man who is good with his hands and has a knack with cars.\n\nThis latter point really nails it for Brett as he tells Tyler he did have a grandfather who ran a gas service station for 40 years. He used to teach them how to maintain cars and how to do tasks like changing a tyre.\n\nTalking to the camera Brett says: \u201cI kept saying to myself he\u2019s making this up he\u2019s making this up, but he just hit that\u2026pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to say that Tyler \u201cgave him chills and it was a good feeling\u201d.\n\nAlso on this episode, Shanola Hampton is given a reading as a gift from her co-star Amy Smart and makes a very deep connection with her late mother.\n\nBrooke Burn also looks to Tyler for some answers about a double tragedy and Tyler finds out something disturbing about Linda Blair\u2019s dog rescue.\n\nTyler Henry Connects With Singer Brett Eldredge's Grandpa | Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry | E!\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nSign up for our TV newsletter!\n\nHollywood Medium airs on Wednesdays at 9:00 PM on E!", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ec50286b2341570aa873e12cf6361297?s=70&d=mm&r=g", "https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brett-eldridge-hollywood-medium.jpg?fit=800%2C406&ssl=1", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fb_KCcEnRsgY%2F0.jpg", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/themes/generatepress_child/images/twitter.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brett-eldridge-hollywood-medium.jpg?resize=773.5%2C393&ssl=1", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/themes/generatepress_child/images/email.png", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/themes/generatepress_child/images/facebook.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mc-logo-2022.png?fit=256%2C80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brett-eldridge-hollywood-medium.jpg?fit=800%2C406&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Wray"], "canonical_link": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/tv/sceptical-country-music-star-brett-eldredge-gets-chills-after-tylers-reading-on-hollywood-medium/", "title": "Sceptical Brett Eldredge gets chills after Tyler\u2019s reading on Hollywood Medium", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "p": {"domain_verify": "9abcc0658f1dd4ad8d86a2c33eba0388"}, "google-site-verification": "W0V7_Td7mscUYxsJwzRBhIxHF4JB2PnzdGVKDImP54o", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Brett Eldredge is initially sceptical but is won over as Tyler Henry reads for him on Hollywood Medium.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Sceptical Brett Eldredge gets chills after Tyler's reading on Hollywood Medium", "description": "Brett Eldredge is initially sceptical but is won over as Tyler Henry reads for him on Hollywood Medium.", "url": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/tv/sceptical-country-music-star-brett-eldredge-gets-chills-after-tylers-reading-on-hollywood-medium/", "site_name": "Monsters and Critics", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/brett-eldridge-hollywood-medium.jpg?fit=800%2C406&ssl=1", "width": 800, "height": 406, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/monsterscritics", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/jamesnicholaswray", "published_time": "2017-08-02T15:58:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-07-04T20:01:37+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/jameswray", "site": "@monstersandcrit"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.9.2", "jetpack-boost-ready": "true", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cropped-MonstersAndCritics-flat-fix-pink-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501689510.0, "source": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com", "summary": ""}
