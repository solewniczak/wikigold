More often than not we feel completely isolated from most everyone we know and even our friends. Our lives are so different and our goals and motivations are usually so drastically different that it fees like we are pretty much alone in this. I initially pre-ordered this book for my husband for his birthday as a way to hopefully help him feel less alone. What I did not realize is how much we would BOTH enjoy this book. Not only did reading this make us feel more concrete and motivated in our decisions to pursue and continue growing our businesses, it made us realize just how unlimited our potential is as long as we work hard. We were already huge fans of Fixer Upper, subscribers to Magnolia Journal and frequent Magnolia Market shoppers but now we feel an even deeper connection. I know we don't know them other than what we see via media but because they portray a more real version of themselves and we understand their experiences it's like we know them. My husband and Chip are basically the same person and I almost always share the same sentiment as Joanna, bless us. We have now added visiting the Magnolia empire in Waco to our bucket list. (side bar- how funny anyone 10 years ago would have thought that Waco would be on anyone's bucket list!) Even if you aren't a builder or a realtor or even a business owner this book is still fantastic. I also highly recommend listening to the book because it's narrated by Chip!", "images": ["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hZQ5WV1kL._CR0,204,1224,1224_UX175.jpg",
