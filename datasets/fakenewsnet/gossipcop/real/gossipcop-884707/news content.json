Sketch With Jimmy Fallon\n\nThe laughter-filled prank was a fun, feel-good segment to celebrate \"Miley Week,\" a noticeable contrast to the singer's appearance on Monday's episode, where she opened the show with a powerful rendition of Dido's \"No Freedom.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old pop star was joined by Adam Sandler on guitar, and the pair dedicated the emotional performance to the victims of the Las Vegas shooting on Sunday.\n\nWATCH: Chris Pratt and Chris Evans Photobomb Unsuspecting Super Bowl Fans, Hilarity Ensues\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t the first time Cyrus and Fallon have surprised random people for a bit on the late night talk show. Back in June, the pair went undercover, in full disguise, as street musicians in a New York City subway station.\n\nWhile the pair were somewhat unrecognizable, Cyrus' flawless soulful cover of Dolly Parton's \"Jolene\" attracted a lot of attention and soon the pair revealed themselves. Check out the video below for a look at the impressive stunt.", "images": ["https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-523126.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1280_mileycyrus_tonightshow_100617.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=V4NKi6Gh", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-523509.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-03/GettyImages-1385596769%20%283%29.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=W-q4VTuE", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-521682.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-522166.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-521667.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-521738.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-523820.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-522106.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-521688.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/miley_cyrus_jimmy_fallon_photobomb_tonight_show_nbc_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=g01e8QBJ", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-521402.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-521069.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-521370.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-523506.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-523076.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-521039.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-522165.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-521414.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-03/GettyImages-1385572804%20%283%29.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=7sWup9fu", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-523123.png"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/miley_cyrus_jimmy_fallon_photobomb_tonight_show_nbc_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=g01e8QBJ", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jimmy-fallon-and-miley-cyrus-photobomb-unsuspecting-fans-adorable-tonight-show-sketch-88544", "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Miley Cyrus Photobomb Unsuspecting Fans In Adorable 'Tonight Show' Sketch", "meta_data": {"robots": "index", "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "description": "Watching the TV host and the singer adorably surprise fans is one of the most delightful things you'll see all day.", "keywords": "TV, Miley Cyrus, Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jimmy-fallon-and-miley-cyrus-photobomb-unsuspecting-fans-adorable-tonight-show-sketch-88544", "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Miley Cyrus Photobomb Unsuspecting Fans In Adorable 'Tonight Show' Sketch", "description": "Watching the TV host and the singer adorably surprise fans is one of the most delightful things you'll see all day.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/miley_cyrus_jimmy_fallon_photobomb_tonight_show_nbc_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=g01e8QBJ", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Watching the TV host and the singer adorably surprise fans is one of the most delightful things you'll see all day.", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Miley Cyrus Photobomb Unsuspecting Fans In Adorable 'Tonight Show' Sketch", "creator": "Zach Seemayer\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jimmy-fallon-and-miley-cyrus-photobomb-unsuspecting-fans-adorable-tonight-show-sketch-88544", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/miley_cyrus_jimmy_fallon_photobomb_tonight_show_nbc_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=g01e8QBJ"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/BgxO_WLSiMM?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
