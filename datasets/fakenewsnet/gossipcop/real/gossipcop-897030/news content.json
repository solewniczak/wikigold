The Star Trek captain stand-off concluded Tuesday evening with a ceremonial unblocking followed by playful banter:\n\nReferring, of course, to Issacs\u2019 role as Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nShatner never publicly said why he blocked the Star Trek: Discovery star in the first place, but we\u2019re pretty sure it had something to do with an interview that arguably mischaracterized Isaacs as saying he would never want Shatner to be a guest star on the new series.\n\n\u201cKirk doesn\u2019t come along for 10 years and when we meet him, he\u2019s 26, so it would be a weird timeline if [Issacs\u2019 character met Kirk],\u201d Isaacs reportedly said in a U.K. tabloid story headlined \u201cJason Isaacs hopes William Shatner won\u2019t appear in Star Trek: Discovery.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSomeone asked which cast members from the existing series would you like to guest star. I think people watch good drama shows and they completely suspend their disbelief, they feel like they\u2019re looking through the keyhole at another world, if you do it well enough. If you have stunt celebrity cameo casting, it completely pulls them out of it. They feel like they\u2019re watching a Saturday Night Live sketch. So I just hope people believe our stories, are engaged with them, and I\u2019m happy to meet Will Shatner in real life in a restaurant.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F11%2F11%2Fjames-hibberd-image.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F01%2Fgettyimages-501323914-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fkirk1-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fkirk1-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fkirk1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Hibberd", "November", "At Pm Est"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/11/28/william-shatner-jason-isaacs-twitter/", "title": "William Shatner ends Star Trek feud, unblocks Jason Isaacs on Twitter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Jason Isaacs,William Shatner", "news_keywords": "Jason Isaacs,William Shatner", "description": "And teases him about 'Harry Potter' in the process \u2026", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "'Star Trek' peace: William Shatner forgives Jason Isaacs, unblocks him on Twitter", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/11/28/william-shatner-jason-isaacs-twitter/", "description": "And teases him about 'Harry Potter' in the process \u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fkirk1-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/11/28/william-shatner-jason-isaacs-twitter/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fkirk1-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/11/28/william-shatner-jason-isaacs-twitter/", "title": "'Star Trek' peace: William Shatner forgives Jason Isaacs, unblocks him on Twitter", "description": "And teases him about 'Harry Potter' in the process \u2026", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fkirk1-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/11/28/william-shatner-jason-isaacs-twitter/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511823600.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
