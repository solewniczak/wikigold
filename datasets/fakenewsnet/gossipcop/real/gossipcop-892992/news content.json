{"url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-11-10-10-of-the-sexiest-lyrics-from-taylor-swifts-reputation/", "text": "As indicated by the feisty lead single \"Look What You Made Me Do\" and bold pre-album-release track \"...Ready For It?,\" reputation is Swift's most attitude-filled album yet. Still, it wouldn't be a Taylor Swift album without love weaved in its fabric. It's been widely reported that Swift is currently in a relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn, and by the looks of some of her lyrics throughout the album, they are very happy together.\n\nThat said, with reputation only hours old, we don't have nearly enough evidence to know the meanings behind these songs for certain. But even without knowing specific details and stories that led to the creation of this tracklist, one thing is plainly clear: Swift's songwriting has gotten quite risque.\n\nHere are 10 of the sexiest lyrics from reputation.\n\n\"...Ready For It?\"\n\n\"In the middle of the night, in my dreams / You should see the things we do, baby\"\n\n\"End Game\"\n\n\"It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold / You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks / So here's a truth from my red lips\"\n\n\"Don't Blame Me\"\n\n\"Lord, save me, my drug is my baby / I'll be usin' for the rest of my life\"\n\n\"Delicate\"\n\n\"Do the girls back home touch you like I do? / Long night, with your hands up in my hair\"\n\n\"So It Goes...\"\n\n\"Lipstick on your face / So it goes\u2026 / I'm yours to keep / And I'm yours to lose / You know I'm not a bad girl, but I / Do bad things with you\"\n\n\"King of My Heart\"\n\n\"So prove to me I'm your American Queen / And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat / And we rule the kingdom inside my room\"\n\n\"Late in the night, the city's asleep / Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep / Change my priorities / The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury\"\n\n\"Dancing with Our Hands Tied\"\n\n\"And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis\"\n\n\"Dress\"\n\n\"Carve your name into my bedpost / \u2019Cause I don't want you like a best friend / Only bought this dress so you could take it off\"\n\n\"All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation / My hands are shaking from holding back from you\"", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59dfb702f7effd8fc0cd225e?ops=contain(1480,0)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59dfb702f7effd8fc0cd225e"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59dfb702f7effd8fc0cd225e", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Armstrong"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-11-10-10-of-the-sexiest-lyrics-from-taylor-swifts-reputation/", "title": "10 Of The Sexiest Lyrics From Taylor Swift's 'reputation'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5.0, user-scalable=yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#C6002B", "description": "Swift's sixth studio album, reputation, has arrived | iHeart", "fb": {"app_id": 121897277851831, "pages": 55354819171}, "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59dfb702f7effd8fc0cd225e", "description": "Swift's sixth studio album, reputation, has arrived | iHeart", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-11-10-10-of-the-sexiest-lyrics-from-taylor-swifts-reputation/", "site_name": "iHeart", "title": "10 Of The Sexiest Lyrics From Taylor Swift's 'reputation' | iHeart"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59dfb702f7effd8fc0cd225e", "twitter": {"image": {"identifier": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59dfb702f7effd8fc0cd225e", "src": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59dfb702f7effd8fc0cd225e"}, "description": "Swift's sixth studio album, reputation, has arrived | iHeart", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-11-10-10-of-the-sexiest-lyrics-from-taylor-swifts-reputation/", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "iHeart", "ipad": "iHeart", "googleplay": "iHeart"}, "id": {"iphone": 290638154, "ipad": 290638154, "googleplay": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}}, "creator": "@iHeartRadio", "site": "@iHeartRadio", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "iheart.com", "title": "10 Of The Sexiest Lyrics From Taylor Swift's 'reputation' | iHeart"}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "iHeart", "package": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}, "ios": {"app_name": "iHeart", "app_store_id": 290638154}}, "keywords": "10 Of The Sexiest Lyrics From Taylor Swift's 'reputation', 10, of, the, sexiest, lyrics, from, taylor, swift's, 'reputation'", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-author": "Megan Armstrong, Billboard", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59dfb702f7effd8fc0cd225e", "parsely-link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-11-10-10-of-the-sexiest-lyrics-from-taylor-swifts-reputation/", "parsely-network-canonical": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-11-10-10-of-the-sexiest-lyrics-from-taylor-swifts-reputation/", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-11-10T15:11:00.000Z", "parsely-section": "National - Trending (CHR Rhythmic) (501919)", "parsely-title": "10 Of The Sexiest Lyrics From Taylor Swift's 'reputation'", "parsely-tags": "Taylor Swift (33221)"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510268400.0, "source": "https://www.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
