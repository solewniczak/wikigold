For other uses, see BTS (disambiguation)\n\nBTS (Korean: \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.[5] The septet\u2014consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook\u2014co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work also often references literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.\n\nAfter debuting in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS released their first Korean-language studio album, Dark & Wild, and Japanese-language studio album, Wake Up, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the global music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records. They became the first Korean group to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single \"Mic Drop\", as well as the first Korean act to top the US Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018). BTS became one of the few groups since the Beatles to earn four US number-one albums in less than two years, and Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Global 200 and US Billboard Hot 100 with their Grammy-nominated single \"Dynamite\". Their follow-up releases \"Savage Love\", \"Life Goes On\", \"Butter\", and \"Permission to Dance\" made BTS the fastest act to accumulate five US number-one singles since Michael Jackson.\n\nHaving sold over 32 million albums on the Gaon Music Chart, BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds the best-selling album in South Korea with Map of the Soul: 7. They are the first Asian and non-English speaking act to be named the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's (IFPI) Global Recording Artist of the Year (2020\u20132021), to chart on Billboard's Top Touring Artists of the 2010s (placing at number 45), and to headline and sell out Wembley Stadium and Rose Bowl Stadium (Love Yourself World Tour in 2019).

Outside of music, they partnered with UNICEF to establish the Love Myself anti-violence campaign, addressed three United Nations General Assemblies, and became the youngest ever recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit from the President of South Korea due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language.\n\nName\n\nThe group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean phrase Bangtan Sonyeondan (Korean: \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8; Hanja: \u9632\u5f48|\u5c11\u5e74|\u5718), literally meaning \"Bulletproof Boy Scouts\". According to member J-Hope, the name signifies the group's desire \"to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets\".[6][7] In Japan, they are known as B\u014ddan Sh\u014dnendan (\u9632\u5f3e\u5c11\u5e74\u56e3), which translates similarly.[8] In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for \"Beyond the Scene\" as part of their new brand identity.[9] This extended their name to mean \"growing youth BTS who is going beyond the realities they are facing, and going forward.\"[10]\n\nCareer\n\nBTS in 2013 performing at the Incheon Music Center\n\n2010\u20132014: Formation and early years\n\nBTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk met with group leader RM and was impressed with his rapping.[11] BTS was originally supposed to be a hip hop group similar to YG Entertainment's 1TYM,[12] but between their initial formation and their debut, Bang Si-hyuk decided instead to create an idol group similar to Seo Taiji and Boys who were popular in the 90's. A group able to make socially conscious music without the restrictions K-pop bands were known for, able to be sincere and genuine at a time where K-pop bands were highly regimented.[13] Originally slated to debut in 2011, the group featured on several tracks by artists like 2AM and Lee Seung-gi before their debut was postponed. They were later reorganized into a more traditional idol group.[14] Six months prior to their debut, they began to gain attention for their presence on various social media websites, as well as song covers on YouTube and SoundCloud.[15][16]\n\nWe started to tell the stories that people wanted to hear and were ready to hear, stories that other people could not or would not tell. We said what other people were feeling\u2014like pain, anxieties and worries. That was our goal, to create this empathy that people can relate to. \u2014Suga[17]\n\nOn June 12, 2013, BTS released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, the first installment of their \"school trilogy\" series, simultaneously with its lead single \"No More Dream\", which quickly fell off the charts.[18][19] The album, however, reached the top five in South Korea on the Gaon Music Chart.[20] Their subsequent single \"We Are Bulletproof Pt. 2\" failed to chart. In 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS employed an old-school hip-hop sound with scratches from the 1980s\u201390s and strong visuals.[21] The single album's release was followed by several appearances on Korean music shows.[22][23] Despite being unpolished, critics say these early live performances demonstrated BTS' potential.[22] Expanding their endeavors to Japan, \"No More Dream\" was later re-recorded in Japanese and released in June 2014.[24]\n\nIn September 2013, BTS released the second part to their \"school trilogy,\" the extended play O!RUL8,2?, along with its single \"N.O,\".[25] Despite several performances on Korean music shows, the single quickly fell off the charts.[26] That same month, BTS starred in their own variety show, SBS MTV's Rookie King Channel Bangtan, which members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and MasterChef Korea.[27] At the end of the year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards, including the 2013 Melon Music Awards, 28th Golden Disc Awards, and the 23rd Seoul Music Awards.[28][29][30]\n\n2014\u20132017: Mainstream and international breakthrough\n\nModerate success and first concert tour\n\nExterior of the nightclub Troubadour (photo taken 2006) where BTS held their first concert in the US for free\n\nThe last act of their \"school trilogy\", the EP Skool Luv Affair,[5] was released in January 2014 and topped the Gaon Album Chart.[31] It also marked BTS' first appearance on Billboard's World Albums Chart, peaking at number three.[5][32] The album was supported by the singles \"Boy in Luv\" (Korean: \uc0c1\ub0a8\uc790;

Their album Wings (2016) was inspired by Hermann Hesse's coming of age novel, Demian.[270] Their song \"Blood Sweat and Tears\" (2016) quotes Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and its music video features visual references to Herbert James Draper's The Lament for Icarus, Pieter Bruegel's Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, and Pieter Bruegel's The Fall of the Rebel Angels.[271] Their \"Spring Day\" (2017) music video contains lyrical and visual references to Ursula Le Guin's short story The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.[272] The Love Yourself series was primarily influenced by Erich Fromm's The Art of Loving,[273] while their song \"Magic Shop\" from Love Yourself: Tear (2018) was inspired by James R. Doty's memoir Into the Magic Shop.[274] Their 2019 album, Map of the Soul: Persona gained its name from Murray Stein's Jung's Map of the Soul: An Introduction.[275]\n\nMusical style\n\nBTS co-write and produce much of their own output.[276][277] Since their inception, BTS have had an emphasis on hip hop as their musical base largely due to the influence of RM and Suga's background as underground rappers[12] and their main producer Pdogg.[278] Rather than adhering to a specific genre, BTS have introduced new elements into their sound and musical repertoire with each successive release.[279][280][281] Beginning with old-school hip hop on 2 Cool 4 Skool and O!RUL8,2? in 2013,[21] BTS first experimented with R&B and rock on Skool Luv Affair and Dark & Wild in 2014;[282][40] orchestral strings and EDM in their The Most Beautiful Moment in Life album series (2015\u201316);[54] moombahton, neo soul, and gospel on Wings (2016) and You Never Walk Alone (2017);[283][68] future bass, Latin pop, and jazz hip hop in their Love Yourself album series (2017\u201318);[85] emo rap, rap rock, Afro pop, nu-disco, funk, trap, pop rock and pop rap in their Map of the Soul album series (2019\u201320);[284][285][286][287][288] and dance-pop and disco in their singles \"Dynamite\", \"Butter\", and \"Permission to Dance\" (2020\u201321).[289][290]\n\nLyrical themes\n\nSince their inception, BTS have believed that telling their story is the best way for the younger generation to relate to their music.[291] Writing the majority of their own lyrics,[276][292] the group incorporates universal life experiences, such as sadness and loneliness, in their work and turn them into something more light and manageable. RM has stated that BTS tries to not sound as if they are preaching or reprimanding people in their songs, \"...because that's not the way that we want to spread our message. [...] We're born with different lives, but you cannot choose some things. So we thought that love, the real meaning of it, starts with loving ourselves and accepting some ironies and some destinies that we have from the very start\".[293] When asked if it is difficult to write about things like mental health, Suga responded,\n\nWe feel that people who have the platform to talk about those things really should talk more, because they say depression is something where you go to the hospital and you're diagnosed, but you can't really know until the doctor talks to you. [...] More and more, I think artists or celebrities who have a voice should talk about these problems and bring it up to the surface.[294]\n\nThe lyrical themes explored in the songs and albums of BTS have included diverse themes such as the issues of social identity in youth, anxieties of school-age youth, and mental health in youth culture.[10] According to a 2017 analysis by Billboard magazine, BTS' albums contain recurring youth-related themes.[10] Their \"school trilogy\" from 2013 to 2014 explored \"the troubles and anxieties of school-age youth.\"[295] In 2016, their approach to discussing youth culture issues in South Korea \"tackled a subject that the vast majority of youth experience, but few pop musicians articulate well: mental health and the desire to belong in society.\"[295] Wings (2016) focused on temptation and sin.[296] The \"Love Yourself\" series introduced various themes dealing with youth culture in South Korea including the excitement of love, the pains of farewell, and the enlightenment of self-love.[297] Their lyrics, which often include social commentary and criticisms of the interaction of South Korean youth culture with South Korean society, clearly reflect these.\"[295]\n\nIn 2018, songs such as \"No More Dream\" and \"N.O\" from their school trilogy were described by Tamar Herman as being motivated by their experiences with South Korea's emphasis on education and called for change to the education system and societal expectations.[298] Their experiences with youth culture in South Korea inspired the songs \"Dope\" and \"Silver Spoon\" (Korean: \ubc41\uc0c8; RR : Baepsae) from their youth trilogy, referencing generational disparity and millennials giving up of romantic relationships, marriage, children, proper employment, homes, and social life in the face of economic difficulties and societal ills while facing condemnation from the media and older generations.[298]\n\n\"Am I Wrong\" from Wings (2016) questioned societal apathy towards the state of current events\u2014the lyric \"We're all dogs and pigs / we become dogs because we're angry\" referenced the South Korean Ministry of Education official Na Hyang-wook, who was a proponent of the caste system and described the average person as \"dogs and pigs\", and BTS performed the song on television during the 2016 South Korean political scandal that led to the impeachment of ex-President Park Geun-hye.[298] RM and Suga's personal struggles with mental health inspired songs like \"Tomorrow\", \"Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life\", \"So Far Away\", \"The Last\", and \"Forever Rain.\"[299][300] \"Not Today\" from You Never Walk Alone (2017) is an anti-establishment anthem, with messages advocating for minority groups,[301] while \"Spring Day\" honored the victims of the Sewol Ferry tragedy.[302] BTS have been praised for \"speak[ing] honestly about topics they deem important, even in a conservative society\" by Jeff Benjamin in Fuse magazine.[303] South Korean president Moon Jae-in recognized their sincerity and inclusion of diversity as key to their success, writing, \"Each of the seven members sings in a way that is true to himself and the life he wants to live. Their melody and lyrics transcend regional borders, language, culture, and institutions.\"[304]\n\nLegacy and cultural impact\n\nBTS performing at the Korea-France Friendship Concert in Paris on October 14, 2018\n\nOn April 29, 2019 Time magazine named BTS on their \"The 100 Most Influential People\" of the year list, giving them the nickname \"Princes of Pop\".[305] Billboard executive Silvio Pietroluongo compared BTS' commercial success and influence to that of the Beatles and the Monkees.[306] MRC Data executive Helena Kosinski noted that \"although BTS weren't the first to open the doors to K-Pop worldwide, they were the first to become mainstream. They don't just appeal to young people but also to the 50s and 60s age demographic\".[307] As the first non-English speaking artist to make the Global Artist Chart in 2018, BTS had the second and third best-selling albums worldwide and were the second best-selling artists worldwide across multiple media platforms, second only to Drake.[308][309][310] In 2020, BTS became the first non-western and non-English speaking artist to be named IFPI's Global Recording Artist of the Year.[242] In South Korea, BTS accounted for 41.9 percent of album sales in the first half of 2019, up from their market share of 25.3 percent the previous year.[311]\n\nThe group's influence has led them to address the 73rd United Nations General Assembly[312][313] and perform before 400 officials, including South Korean president Moon Jae-in, at the 2018 Korea-France Friendship Concert in Paris, a summit celebrating the friendly relations between France and South Korea.[314] That year, BTS also became the youngest ever recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit. Despite cultural medals traditionally being given to recipients with over 15 years of notable achievements, President Moon recognized the group, five years into their career, for their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language worldwide.[315][316] In September 2019, BTS were mentioned by President Moon in his announcement for his \"3 major innovation strategies for the contents industry\" for having pioneered innovative business models that communicate directly with fans.[317] In 2020, BTS were bestowed the James A. Van Fleet Award in recognition of their outstanding contributions to the promotion of US-Korea relations; to date, they are the youngest honorees and only musicians to receive the award in its history.[318] In July 2021, they were appointed Special Presidential Envoy for Future Generations and Culture by President Moon. In their role as envoys, they help to \"raise awareness on global agendas, such as sustainable development, to our future generations and to strengthen the nation's diplomatic power across the world\"[319] and represent South Korea at various international events, such as the 76th United Nations General Assembly.[320]\n\nCommercial endorsements\n\nBTS have maintained numerous global endorsement deals in various industries throughout their career. Partnered with Puma since 2015, BTS initially promoted its sportswear as Puma Korea's brand ambassadors before expanding to become global ambassadors in 2018[321][322] and promoting the remix of Puma's \"Turin\" and \"Sportstyle\" line worldwide.[323][324] In 2019, BTS signed with Fila to endorse its sportswear.[325] BTS has also served as global brand ambassadors for LG Electronics' 2018 LG G7 ThinQ telephone,[326] and for Hyundai Motors' 2019 flagship SUV the \"Palisade\"[327] and hydrogen fuel cell electric SUV, the \"Nexo\".[328] Due to BTS' endorsement, Hyundai received almost double the anticipated domestic order volume for the Palisade.[329] BTS became global ambassadors of the electric street racing series Formula E to promote how electric vehicles can help combat climate change.[330] In 2020, BTS partnered with Samsung Electronics,[331] releasing a limited BTS-themed version of the Galaxy S20+ and Galaxy Buds+.[332] As the first male pop group ever to collaborate with Dior, BTS sported ensembles from Kim Jones' Pre-Fall 2019 collection at their concert at Stade de France.[333] Since April 2021, BTS have been Louis Vuitton brand ambassadors.[334]\n\nAwards and achievements\n\nBTS has been the recipient of many awards and honors, including 33 Mnet Asian Music Awards, 29 Melon Music Awards, 24 Golden Disc Awards, 20 Seoul Music Awards, six Korean Music Awards, 19 Gaon Chart Music Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards, six American Music Awards, and six MTV Video Music Awards.
