I took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said.\u201d\n\n\u201cI continue to support the movement that is happening in our culture,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is necessary and long overdue.\u201d\n\n775039469PH00124_69th_Annua Aziz Ansari and Lena Waithe\n\nWaithe, 33, previously touched on the Ansari allegation in an interview with KPCC\u2019s The Frame.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Faziz-ansari-lena-waithe-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1553&h=777&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Faziz-ansari-lena-waithe-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1553&h=777&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Faziz-ansari-lena-waithe-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios", "March"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/lena-waite-reflects-aziz-ansari-sexual-misconduct-allegation/", "title": "Lena Waite Reflects on Aziz Ansari Sexual Misconduct Allegation", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Aziz Ansari,Master of None,News", "news_keywords": "Aziz Ansari,Master of None,News", "description": "\"We need to be more attuned to each other, pay more attention to each other, in every scenario,\" says Waithe", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Lena Waithe Reflects on Aziz Ansari Allegation,\u00a0Hopes We 'Educate Ourselves' About Sexual Consent", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/lena-waite-reflects-aziz-ansari-sexual-misconduct-allegation/", "description": "\"We need to be more attuned to each other, pay more attention to each other, in every scenario,\" says Waithe", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1553&h=777&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Faziz-ansari-lena-waithe-1.jpg", "width": 1553, "height": 777}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/lena-waite-reflects-aziz-ansari-sexual-misconduct-allegation/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Faziz-ansari-lena-waithe-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/lena-waite-reflects-aziz-ansari-sexual-misconduct-allegation/", "title": "Lena Waithe Reflects on Aziz Ansari Allegation,\u00a0Hopes We 'Educate Ourselves' About Sexual Consent", "description": "\"We need to be more attuned to each other, pay more attention to each other, in every scenario,\" says Waithe", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1553&h=777&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Faziz-ansari-lena-waithe-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/lena-waite-reflects-aziz-ansari-sexual-misconduct-allegation/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
