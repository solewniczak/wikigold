They said that the intention was to have a kind of break before the climactic final two episodes.\n\nRELATED: \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Kids Watch Their Own Audition Tapes\n\n\u201cIt was sort of like a pilot, but there was no intention to do a spinoff or anything. But it does feel like that. It\u2019s a totally different show embedded within the show. Because we wanted Eleven to have her own journey and have this journey of self-discovery or whatever, that\u2019s why we did it,\u201d Matt explained.\n\nHe continued: \u201cWhen we got to the point of writing the episode, we wanted to see if we really needed it or not. We actually did toy with pulling the episode completely, but then the ending with Eleven didn\u2019t work at all. It just didn\u2019t land at all. Then we ended up deciding we needed it.\u201d\n\nThe Duffers did say that part of their reason for making the episode was the chance to do something different by leaving the town of Hawkins. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the reasons we wanted to do [the episode]. It allows you to play with the tones that we never would\u2019ve been able to explore within Hawkins,\u201d Ross said.\n\nRELATED: Dacre Montgomery Releases \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Audition Tape\n\nOriginally, though, it wasn\u2019t supposed to be a sister Millie Bobby Brown\u2019s character Eleven meets.\n\n\u201cWe put out, like a year or so ago, a teaser with what we thought might be chapter titles, and one of them was \u201cThe Lost Brother,\u201d because it was supposed to be a brother,\u201d Matt said.\n\n\u201cSo we opened it up to younger actors, we opened it up to women, and then we read a guy with Millie, and we read Linnea with Millie,\u201d he added. \u201cLinnea and Millie really had a connection. Millie was like, \u2018I want to do this with Linnea.\u2019\u201d", "images": ["https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/shutterstock_editorial_12645322bo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/161059_3995.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/corus.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/ad-choices.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/awards-banner-350x150.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/global.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1300924332.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1384867282.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/newsletter/newsletter-large.jpg", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wv_publicity_post_launch_still_26-000001.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1238909632.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/OTWAliceandMaster02.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/cj058gk7ve-j85qdlk7px/ETC031522TBTJulietteLewisBestRoles01.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=90", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/162238_3320.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/ofy7npnbai-2nl2qwcfrt/ETC031522CelebEstateStallone.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/3l46mqci6d-epaiw19ua7/ETC0315TheLostCityPremiere.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/thumbnail_brick-340x150-1.jpeg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/3yzy074ydc-hdhxiluc50/A11_Ben_Affleck_JLo_Spain_and_Deep_Water.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=82", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/n2i3742.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/royals-brick-340x150-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wv_publicity_post_launch_still_26-000001.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Corey Atad"], "canonical_link": "https://etcanada.com/news/269544/stranger-things-creators-say-they-considered-pulling-polarizing-eleven-episode/", "title": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Creators Say They Considered Pulling Polarizing Eleven Episode", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "x4SpOp2Us67I6MlQN2uFse9KXvwgu1d8_r5F2qkIbYc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 5.9.2", "title": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Creators Say They Considered Pulling Polarizing Eleven Episode", "author": "Corey Atad", "description": "Fans weren't the only ones polarized by the seventh episode of \"Stranger Things\" Season 2.
