The Flip or Flop star purchased a new home this spring, right around the time the mansion he shared with ex-wife Christina El Moussa went on the market for $3 million (and sold within a month).\n\n\"It's so amazing to FINALLY have a home....a real home for me and my babies,\" Tarek, who split from Christina in 2016, captioned an Instagram photo of the page in People where his Costa Mesa, CA, house tour appeared. \"It's nice to have stability and call a place home after all these years. Brayden loves his race car themed room and Taylor loves her Mermaid room!!\"\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.

My \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f Babies finally get a home with daddy!!!\"\n\nThe purchase apparently came in under budget at $2.28 million, and though he loved it as-is, he couldn't resist the opportunity to make it his own. \"I did floor to ceiling wallpaper as an accent wall,\" he wrote in a sneak peek on Instagram, \"how cool is that!?\"\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.

And that kitchen! Simply swoonworthy.\n\n\n\nIn the current season of Flip or Flop, Tarek has been more involved in the design process than ever, and his new property gave him the perfect opportunity to flex those muscles once more, right down to the furnishings. \"I had nothing,\" Tarek told People. \"When I left, I left. So I got to design and build most of the furniture.\"\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.

The series will also focus on Christina's personal life; she has been dating boyfriend Ant Anstead for nine months.\n\nThis content is imported from {embed-name}.
