While the photos of the whole family included a few new members, namely Meghan Markle and Pippa Middleton's husband James Matthews, they were also missing Gan-Gan, Prince Louis's great-grandmother the Queen.\n\nMatt Holyoak/Camera Press/Redux Camerapress_03616268_web.jpg\n\nBoth the Queen and Prince Philip missed Louis's baptism on Monday, and therefore weren't there for the official portraits marking the occasion. According to the Press Association,\"The decision [for the Queen and Prince Philip to miss Louis's christening] was not made on health grounds, Buckingham Palace says, and it is understood to have been mutually agreed by the Queen and the Cambridges some time ago.\"\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter.

On Tuesday, she participated in a number of events marking the 100th anniversary of the Royal Air Force and on Friday, she met with US President Donald Trump at Windsor Castle.\n\nThat said, photographer Matt Holyoak did include a hidden tribute to the British monarch in Louis's official christening photots. Just over Michael Middleton's shoulder is a portrait of the Queen.\n\n\n\nThis isn't the first time a member of the royal family missed a christening. Prince Harry was not at Princess Charlotte's christening back in 2015. According to People, he was in Africa at the time, working with endangered animals in Namibia.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.
