The Suits actress has decided to retire from her acting career, as her new focus is on her future husband and royal duties.\n\nMeghan isn\u2019t necessarily sad about her choice to leave acting behind. \u201cI see it is a new change, a new chapter,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on my show seven years, we were so fortunate to have that longevity, and I feel like I checked that box and am very proud of the work I\u2019ve done there.\u201d\n\nHer acting work may be done, but her royal duties have only just begun, which Prince Harry chimed in about. \u201c[There\u2019s a] sense of responsibility from day one,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI fell in love with her and she fell in love with me\u2026but then we had to have some frank conversations for what you\u2019re getting yourself into is a big deal and at the end of the day she chose me and I chose her, whatever we have to tackle individually or together, we will do it as a team. I think she\u2019s capable of anything.\u201d Awww!\n\nWe may not be seeing her act on our TV screens anymore, but Meghan seems excited to start her life with Harry. \u201cI think what\u2019s been so exciting [transitioning] out of my career and into, as you said, the causes I can focus even more energy on, very early out of the gate, [is that you] have a voice that people listen to, a lot of responsibility,\u201d she said. It seems like Meghan\u2019s really embracing the amount of work she\u2019ll have to take on once she marries into the family.\n\nI\u2019m so excited for them, and I think Harry picked the perfect girl.", "images": ["https://cdn.bfldr.com/SH6M70M3/as/2ctgwccjf5f62n4fxh4wmz/daisy_jones_and_the_six?width=698&height=466&fit=crop&auto=webp", "https://cdn.bfldr.com/SH6M70M3/as/wvtb6mbnxnvpnnqscck49s5/The_Summer_I_Turned_Pretty?width=698&height=466&fit=crop&auto=webp", "https://cdn.bfldr.com/SH6M70M3/as/qf9gca-pj36w-btmx8q/shane-rMMBgbiY8ls-unsplash?width=719&height=464&fit=crop&auto=webp", "https://www.hercampus.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=130,height=130,quality=80,fit=crop/wp-content/uploads/wp-user-manager-uploads/2018/08/linkedin.png", "https://cdn.bfldr.com/SH6M70M3/as/jp929tsvps5rhkmr754mgfs/austin_butler?width=698&height=466&fit=crop&auto=webp", "https://www.hercampus.com/wp-content/themes/hercampus/src/img/favicons/front-end/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://www.hercampus.com/wp-content/themes/hercampus/src/img/hc-logo-black.svg", "https://www.hercampus.com/wp-content/themes/hercampus/src/img/hc-logo-white.svg", "https://cdn.bfldr.com/SH6M70M3/as/4gkh7q985nnv4pt4wqnq365/Signs_Of_The_Times?width=698&height=466&fit=crop&auto=webp", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=19270866&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.bfldr.com/SH6M70M3/as/9xxw3mbnpg37gt8qw5xbswkp/Women_Led_Shows_To_Binge_Womens_History_Month?width=698&height=466&fit=crop&auto=webp", "https://cdn.bfldr.com/SH6M70M3/as/p8nwwgtv3xxck8gtbxscc3q9/conversations_with_friends?width=698&height=466&fit=crop&auto=webp", "https://cdn.bfldr.com/SH6M70M3/as/qf9gca-pj36w-btmx8q/shane-rMMBgbiY8ls-unsplash?width=398&height=256&fit=crop&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.hercampus.com/wp-content/themes/hercampus/src/img/favicons/front-end/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abbey Williams", "U Wyoming", "Abbey Is A Senior At The University Of Wyoming", "Is Currently Majoring In Journalism.
