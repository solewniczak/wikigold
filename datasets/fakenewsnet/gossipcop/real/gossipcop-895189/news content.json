Driver, 34, has long said that he does not enjoy watching himself on screen.\n\nNorman Jean Roy\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t just watch it objectively,\u201d he said. \u201cI always hate it and then come back to, like, \u2018Okay, that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s the story.\u2019 I can\u2019t watch it once. I have to watch it five times, you know? The movie is over. It\u2019s on film, so it\u2019s permanent. But if I think about it more, it\u2019s just an obsessive loop I keep playing in my mind that I can\u2019t get caught up in because it\u2019s totally self-destructive and not helpful moving forward.\u201d\n\nNorman Jean Roy\n\nBut when it came to his first Star Wars film, Driver decided he could make an exception.\n\nNorman Jean Roy\n\n\u201cThe Force Awakens is the only movie I\u2019ve sat with an audience and watched,\u201d he said. \u201cJoanne [his wife] hadn\u2019t seen it. I didn\u2019t tell her anything about it. I didn\u2019t tell her I kill Han Solo.\u201d\n\nBut even then, Driver said the experience was less than pleasant.\n\nNorman Jean Roy\n\n\u201cCredits started, the whole scroll at the beginning, and they start screaming, \u2018Oh my God! It\u2019s happening,'\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I flash-forward to where I killed Han, and I got really sick, and went really cold, waiting for when it was over.\u201d\n\nThe Last Jedi hits theaters Dec. 15.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/adam-driver-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C55px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712im_/http://people.com/img/sign-up-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/adam-driver-4.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/adam-driver-2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/adam-driver-1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/adam-driver-3.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/article-covers/3313_106804645_2016_05_02_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/adam-driver-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C55px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712/http://people.com/movies/adam-driver-undecided-on-seeing-star-wars-the-last-jedi/", "title": "Adam Driver Is 'Undecided' on Seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi Despite Being in It", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "adam driver, star wars, star wars the last jedi, the last jedi, star wars movies, kylo ren, star wars kylo ren, adam driver kylo ren", "news_keywords": "adam driver, star wars, star wars the last jedi, the last jedi, star wars movies, kylo ren, star wars kylo ren, adam driver kylo ren", "description": "Driver reprises his role as supervillain Kylo Ren in the famous franchise", "og": {"title": "Adam Driver Is \u2018Undecided\u2019 on Seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi Despite Being in It", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712/http://people.com/movies/adam-driver-undecided-on-seeing-star-wars-the-last-jedi/", "description": "Driver reprises his role as supervillain Kylo Ren in the famous franchise", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/adam-driver-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C55px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://people.com/movies/adam-driver-undecided-on-seeing-star-wars-the-last-jedi/", "description": "Driver reprises his role as supervillain Kylo Ren in the famous franchise", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/adam-driver-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C55px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712im_/http://people.com/movies/adam-driver-undecided-on-seeing-star-wars-the-last-jedi/", "title": "Adam Driver Is \u2018Undecided\u2019 on Seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi Despite Being in It", "description": "Driver reprises his role as supervillain Kylo Ren in the famous franchise", "site": "@people", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171120184712im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/adam-driver-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C55px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
