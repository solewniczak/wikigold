I\u2019m not myself anymore. I\u2019m just too nervous.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSerena reacted with complete understanding, writing back, \u201cDaddy, it\u2019s okay, if you don\u2019t want to come to the wedding at all, that\u2019s okay too. I\u2019m not going to be upset with you about it, so I don\u2019t want you to be upset about it.\u201d\n\nThe 36-year-old athlete \u2014 who welcomed daughter Alexis Olympia just two months before tying the knot with the Reddit co-founder \u2014 explained that she recognized why her father felt uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cMaybe a lot of daughters wouldn\u2019t react the same way, but I know the struggles he\u2019s had these last few years. His health is better now, but I know he still doesn\u2019t feel like himself, doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s perfect,\u201d Serena said. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t want to be up there in front of a lot of people, I completely understand. Look, when we first came on the scene, there were a lot of people who didn\u2019t get him. I don\u2019t think a lot of them wanted to get him. I don\u2019t think a lot of him could have anyway.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cOur family knows what we have. We just want each other to be happy. That\u2019s what matters. I don\u2019t think anything could ever change that.\u201d\n\nSerena ended up walking down the aisle at the Contemporary Art Center of New Orleans solo as violinists performed \u201cHow Far I\u2019ll Go\u201d from the movie Moana.\n\nBritain Tennis Eastbourne Serena Williams and her father, Richard | Credit: Sang Tan/AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\nAlexandra Macon, a Vogue editor who covered the wedding for the magazine, revealed that Serena completely kept her composure despite the sudden change of plans.\n\n\u201cI can only imagine how all over the place her emotions must have been, but she radiated a sense of calm, even when things went wrong,\u201d Macon wrote for Vogue.com. \u201cUnbeknownst to me at the time, her father and longtime coach, Richard, texted her an hour before the wedding was supposed to start, saying that he didn\u2019t feel comfortable walking her down the aisle.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Serena Williams Gives Her Best Wedding Advice For Friend Meghan Markle: \u2018Eat Cake!\u2019\n\nSerena\u2019s friend Meghan Markle will also be without her father on her upcoming wedding day.
