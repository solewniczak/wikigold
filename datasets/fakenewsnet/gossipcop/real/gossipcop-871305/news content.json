Hudson took to her Instagram to celebrate the occasion and explained that she and Fujikawa first crossed paths because of her friendship with his stepsisters. However, she was \u201cenormously pregnant\u201d with her 13-year-old son Ryder with ex-husband Chris Robinson at their earliest encounter.\n\n\u201cA year ago today Danny took me on a hike and what I thought was just a hike with a family friend turned very quickly into an unexpected first date,\u201d she captioned the post. \u201cNo moves were made on this first date. In fact, it took months for him to make a first move! And as a kiss on this bridge would have been nice, the kiss a year later was so much sweeter. So on our 15th year of knowing each other we were able to open our hearts to each other to feel so much pure love and it\u2019s been truly incredible!\u201d\n\nfujikawa-hudson-2000 Fujikawa and Hudson | Credit: Alberto E.
