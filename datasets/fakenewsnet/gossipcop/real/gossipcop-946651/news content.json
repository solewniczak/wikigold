Ortiz wrote about his struggle with depression\n\nLuis D. Ortiz is sharing his difficult truth in the hopes that it will inspire others not to keep their own mental health struggles to themselves.\n\nIn a lengthy message shared via his Instagram page on Saturday, the former Million Dollar Listing: New York star opened up about his ongoing struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cI have been wanting to share this for some time now but have been very reluctant to do so for the very same reasons most of us choose to keep our truths in the dark,\u201d wrote Ortiz, who announced he was leaving the Bravo series in 2016\u2019s season finale. \u201cHowever, ever since Kate [Spade] and [Anthony] Bourdain committed suicide I have been feeling the strong need and responsibility of sharing my truth with the hopes of a positive change.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the past year I have been struggling with depression and during the last three months all I can think of \u2014 day and night \u2014 is putting an end to it all,\u201d he continued, adding that it\u2019s \u201calmost impossible\u201d to \u201cunderstand how selfish this would be for the people that love me.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he wrote: \u201cIn fact, I argue that it is selfish of them to let me live in a place I have convinced myself I no longer want to be a part of. It\u2019s a very stupid, ignorant and blind argument but once you have broken yourself down to the extent of no longer believing in any of your abilities and the value you bring to yourself, the people closest to you and the world you live in it\u2019s extremely difficult to see it that way.\u201d\n\nluis Luis D.

Regardless of who they are and what they have or haven\u2019t accomplished. We constantly feel the need of showing that everything is ok when it really isn\u2019t and that needs to stop,\u201d he remarked. \u201cOur internal battle makes us stronger, yes. But we need to win them first. And sometimes, most times, we can\u2019t win them on our own.\u201d\n\n7th Annual amfAR Inspiration Gala New York - Arrivals Luis D. Ortiz | Credit: Kevin Tachman/Getty\n\nContinuing, he wrote, \u201cWith that said, don\u2019t be afraid of your truth. Be proud of it. Share it if you believe will help you understand it better. It\u2019s the only way you will genuinely evolve. And for those of you with friends or close ones who you see are not being themselves, do not abandon them. Remind them of who they are. Remind them that you\u2019re there for them. Remind them that you love them. They don\u2019t need to be at their lowest to be positively affected by it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s make it cool and sexy to create forward while sharing our truth along the way. Let\u2019s learn to love everyone\u2019s unique truth and perhaps that will elevate our levels of compassion and empathy which will better us as people and our world. We are all amazing. Don\u2019t forget that,\u201d the reality star added. \u201cWith love, Luis.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fluis-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fluis-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F03%2Fgettyimages-539272118-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fluis-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "June"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/health/luis-d-ortiz-reveals-depression-suicidal-thoughts-struggle/", "title": "Luis D.
