[1] The label began in 1969 and the company was founded in 1973. Its French flagship store is in Paris. It also establishes country-wide and world-wide store chain for various lines of products, including Dover Street Market, in major cities such as London, Melbourne, Hong Kong, New York City and Ginza.[2] Other than fashion, it has expanded its business to jewelry and perfume.[3]\n\nThe company shows their main collections during Paris Fashion Week and Paris Men's Fashion Week.[4] In 2017 it was reported that the company and its affiliates generates a revenue \"of over $280 million a year\".[5]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nThe label was started in Tokyo by Rei Kawakubo in 1969 and established as a company in 1973. It is written in Japanese as \u30b3\u30e0\u30fb\u30c7\u30fb\u30ae\u30e3\u30eb\u30bd\u30f3 (Komu de Gyaruson), and translates as \"like boys\" in French.[6] The brand's name was inspired by Fran\u00e7oise Hardy's 1962 song \"Tous les gar\u00e7ons et les filles\", particularly from the line Comme les gar\u00e7ons et les filles de mon \u00e2ge.[7] The brand became successful in Japan in the 1970s and a menswear line was added in 1978. In 1981 the company had a debut show in Paris. Kawakubo's heavy use of black, as well as distressed fabrics and unfinished seams, were viewed negatively by French critics.[8]\n\nThroughout the 1980s, its clothes often were associated with a distressed and punk-oriented style. In 1982, Kawakubo's collection which she named \"Destroy\" was heavily criticized. \"Women's Wear Daily called it the 'Hiroshima bag lady look,' and the Associated Press proclaimed Kawakubo the 'high priestess of the Jap wrap.'\" Unusual styles continued through the 1990s, many of which were disliked by experts.[9] But the company carried on, and in 2004, the company split business into handmade garments in France and non-handmade garments in Japan, Spain and Turkey. Product lines like Deux, Shirt, Tricot, Homme Plus Evergreen, Junya Watanabe, and Ganryu are handmade in France.[10] The product line Play, which is the most recognizable and mainstream CDG casual luxury line, is largely produced in Japan, Spain and Turkey, but some of its product are handmade in France.[10] Filip Pagowski designed the heart logo and stitched onto Play pieces.[11][12]\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons lines [ edit ]\n\nDesigned by Rei Kawakubo\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons \u2013 main womenswear line (since 1969)\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons Noir \u2013 black-dominated womenswear collection (since 1987)\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons Comme Des Gar\u00e7ons \u2013 (a.k.a.

Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Parfums is for licensing some of the perfumes to Puig from 2002[19][20] and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Parfums for selling the rest by its own.[21]\n\nThe company developed a unisex fragrance, G I R L and released it on 28 August 2014.[22] Artist KAWS designed the bottle.[23]\n\nFashion [ edit ]\n\nIts collections are designed in the studio in Aoyama, Tokyo and manufactured in Japan, France, Spain, and Turkey. Over the years, the company has recurrently associated itself with the arts and cultural projects internationally. The 1997 spring-summer collection, often referred to the lumps and bumps collection, which contained fabric in bulk and balls on the garments, led to a collaboration, also in 1997, between Rei Kawakubo and New York-based choreographer Merce Cunningham called Scenario. The 2006 autumn/winter collection dealt with the concept of the persona,[24] the different ways to present self to the world. Fusing tailored menswear with more feminine elements such as corsets and flower printed dress fabrics, Persona was another collection that combined the feminine with the masculine.\n\nJunya Watanabe[25][26] and, as of recently, Tao Kurihara[27][28] have started their own sub-labels under the label. Both also were involved in designing for the casual women's knitwear line Tricot.\n\nComme des Gar\u00e7ons dress\n\nThe company have collaborated with various other labels over the years such as Hammerthor,[29] H&M.[30][31] and St\u00fcssy.[32]\n\nBj\u00f6rk wore the label in the music video for Isobel.[citation needed] Frank Ocean named a song after the company.[33] John Waters devoted a chapter of his 2010 book Role Models to the label and founder.[34][35] Swedish musician Jonna Lee collaborated with the company in the creation of her audiovisual album Everyone Afraid to Be Forgotten, where the fashion house designed the costumes for the film.[36][37][38]\n\nControversies [ edit ]\n\n1995: 'Auschwitz' fashions [ edit ]\n\nThe 1995 \"Sleep\" collection consisted of striped pajamas \"bearing prints of identification numbers and marks of military boot prints\".[39] Contemporaneous media coverage juxtaposed images of the collection with images taken at Auschwitz concentration camp, and the controversy received international coverage.[40][41] The World Jewish Congress condemned the collection,[39] and fashion critic Suzy Menkes called the collection \"'Auschwitz' fashions\".[39][40] Kawakubo responded that the collection had been \"completely misunderstood\" and the controversy made her \"very sad\".[39]\n\n2015: Guarachero boots [ edit ]\n\nThe spring/summer 2015 menswear collection included \"guarachero\" boots based on the Mexican pointy boots of Matehuala, Mexico, raising concerns of cultural appropriation.[42][43]\n\n2020: Black hairstyles [ edit ]\n\nIn January 2020, a predominantly white group of models wore cornrowed lace front wigs in the fall 2020 menswear show.[44] This was seen as the appropriation of Black culture, particularly with the use of traditionally Black hairstyles on non-Black models. Stylist Julien d'Ys responded on Instagram, \"Dear all, My inspiration for the comme des gar\u00e7ons show was Egyptian prince A Look i found truly beautiful and inspirational. A look that was an hommage. Never was it my intention to hurt or offend anyone, ever. If I did I deeply apologize.\"[45]\n\nExhibitions [ edit ]\n\nAfter the Paris d\u00e9but, the company exhibited photographs by Peter Lindbergh at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 1986.[46] In 1990, it held an exhibition of sculpture. And again in 2005 it held an exhibition in Shinjuku, Tokyo of advertising and graphic designs.\n\nIn August 2010, the company opened a 19,000 square feet (1,800 m2) six-level flagship store in Seoul, South Korea featuring a branded art-exhibition space, its first outside Japan.[47]\n\nIn May 2017, Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York held a fashion exhibition with theme Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Art of the In-Between.[48][49]\n\nStores [ edit ]\n\nAoyama Store\n\nSignature boutiques are located in London (as Dover Street Market), Paris, New York City,[50] Beijing,[51] Hong Kong,[52] Seoul, St. Petersburg, Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Fukuoka. The company also maintains concessions at select department stores, such as Isetan.\n\nThe company opened the first Guerrilla stores in 2004 in Berlin.[53] The aim of the Guerrilla stores is to be open for only one year[54] and to spend a minimal amount of money on the interiors.[55] The stores locates away from fashionable hubs and districts of a city. Guerrilla stores have been opened, and subsequently closed, in Reykjavik, Warsaw, Helsinki, Singapore, Stockholm, Athens and others. In July 2007, a Guerrilla Store opened in Beirut, Lebanon, and in February 2008, a Guerrilla Store opened in downtown Los Angeles, the first in the United States.[56] In November 2008, it opened another Guerilla store in the west end of Glasgow. In 2004 its opened another in London of Dover Street Market.[57][58]\n\nIn December 2009, the company opened a 4,400 square feet (410 m2) store in Hong Kong called Under The Ground. Hong Kong also has had a Guerrilla store opened and closed in previous years, run by Silly Thing Hong Kong.[59] In March 2012, it opened a store in Manila. Also, the first Dover Street Market in Japan opened in Ginza.[60] In December 2013, Dover Street Market in New York City opened.[61] In 2021, the company reintroduced its \"Guerilla\" stores, pioneering temporary boutiques that predated the pop-up shop movement by a good decade or so.", "images": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/CdG.JPG/220px-CdG.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/CommeDesGarcons.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Comme_des_Garcons_men_for_H%26M_09.jpg/220px-Comme_des_Garcons_men_for_H%26M_09.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Comme_des_Garcons_at_the_Met_%2862473%29.jpg/1200px-Comme_des_Garcons_at_the_Met_%2862473%29.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Comme_des_Garcons_at_the_Met_%2862473%29.jpg/220px-Comme_des_Garcons_at_the_Met_%2862473%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Comme_des_Gar%C3%A7ons_dress_in_red%2C_white_and_blue.jpg/200px-Comme_des_Gar%C3%A7ons_dress_in_red%2C_white_and_blue.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Comme_des_Garcons_at_the_Met_%2862473%29.jpg/1200px-Comme_des_Garcons_at_the_Met_%2862473%29.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comme_des_Gar%C3%A7ons", "title": "Comme des Gar\u00e7ons", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.38.0-wmf.25", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Comme_des_Garcons_at_the_Met_%2862473%29.jpg/640px-Comme_des_Garcons_at_the_Met_%2862473%29.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 465}, "title": "Comme des Gar\u00e7ons - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
