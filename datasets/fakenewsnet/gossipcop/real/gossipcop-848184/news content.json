He has a new album out, Love \u2013 but it\u2019s one that he admits now might never have been made.\n\nHe\u2019s very emotional. His brown eyes well up at the mere mention of the C word, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s still living in the shadow of what he describes as two years of hell.\n\n\u2018You just want to die,\u2019 he says. \u2018I don\u2019t even know how I was breathing.\n\n'My wife was the same and even though I was the stronger of the two of us, I wasn\u2019t strong. My wife was... I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t make it to the end of the sentence... let\u2019s just say we find out who we are with these things.\n\nMichael admits that he likes to be in control and doesn\u2019t feel comfortable crying. His son Noah has now received the all-clear\n\n'Going through this with Noah, I didn\u2019t question who I was, I just questioned everything else. Why are we here?\n\n'Is this all there is? Because if this is all there is, there has to be something bigger.\u2019\n\nHe says that one way he got through it was to pretend he was Roberto Benigni\u2019s character from Life Is Beautiful. The 1997 film was set in a concentration camp and the way Benigni\u2019s character, Guido, and his son coped was to make a joke of everything.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know if that was a choice, but that\u2019s who I became,\u2019 he says. \u2018For instance, I never called it the hospital, I called it the fun hotel.\n\nThe singer revealed the impact it had on him and his wife of seven years, the stunning Argentinian model and actress Luisana Lopilato (pictured together). He said that his wife took it even harder than he did\n\n'And every day I got extra bedsheets and I\u2019d build a tent for Noah. I just made the best of it. Survival.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been such a difficult exercise. It hurts me, and it hurts to talk about Noah because it\u2019s not my story to tell, it\u2019s his.\n\n'But my whole being\u2019s changed. My perception of life. I don\u2019t know if I can even get through this conversation without crying. And I\u2019ve never lost control of my emotions in public.\u2019\n\nMichael likes to be in control and doesn\u2019t feel comfortable crying. His heroes are the macho singers of the 50s and 60s like Frank Sinatra and Bobby Darin.\n\nAs a teenager he\u2019d take his bible to bed, praying that one day he\u2019d emulate them. \u2018In a weird way talking about it is therapy for me,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018I actually thought I\u2019d never come back to the music business. I never fell out of love with music, I just needed to put it aside.\n\n'What was hard was going to the store to buy hot dogs and toilet paper, going to the gas station. Going for a walk by the sea to clear my head.\n\n'Everyone recognises me and says, \u201cHow\u2019s your son?\u201d When you think you\u2019re close to getting over it you\u2019re sucked right back into it. But at the same time I was given faith in humanity.\n\nMichael admitted that his son's illness made him realise he needed to make a change in his life. He said: 'When this terrible news came in I realised I wasn\u2019t having fun in the music business'. Pictured: Michael and Noah in Spain before his diagnosis\n\n'The media helped me, they weren\u2019t disrespectful. And in those two years my record company never asked me what the plan was. They said, \u201cWe love you and we\u2019re praying for you.\u201d\u2019\n\nI was all set to interview Michael not long after Noah was diagnosed, as he was due to host the 2017 Brit Awards, but the interview was cancelled when he pulled out. \u2018I had no interest in my career and I\u2019m grateful I could afford to take time out,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018I spent a good deal of time with people who weren\u2019t so lucky. When this terrible news came in I realised I wasn\u2019t having fun in the music business.\n\n'I\u2019d lost the joy and at some point just before the Brits I was starting to lose the plot. I\u2019d become desperate to hold onto something I thought I might be losing, and I thought I had to do something special to keep it.\n\n'I\u2019d started to do things out of my comfort zone, like presenting, and the truth is it had been a while since I\u2019d been having fun. I\u2019d started to worry about ticket sales for my tours, what the critics said, what the perception of me might be.\u2019\n\nHe grabs the net voile from behind the curtain and puts it over his face. \u2018I felt like I was living with this over my face and the reality I was seeing was blurred by it.\n\nI decided I\u2019d never read my name again in print, never read a review, and I never have. I decided I\u2019d never use social media again, and I never have\n\n'But the diagnosis made me realise how stupid I\u2019d been to worry about these unimportant things. I was embarrassed by my ego, that it had allowed this insecurity.\n\n'And I decided I\u2019d never read my name again in print, never read a review, and I never have. I decided I\u2019d never use social media again, and I never have.\n\n\u2018I realised that for many years I couldn\u2019t believe I was on the same stage as my heroes, that I was sharing a microphone with Tony Bennett or [Canadian pianist and singer] Diana Krall. I couldn\u2019t believe I was looking across at someone like Paul McCartney, and I\u2019d be saying things like, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get here, but my God it\u2019s harder to stay here.\u201d\n\n'But then I woke up and thought, \u201cAfter ten years of trying to get here and five years of being scared it would go away, I think I can enjoy it.\u201d\u2019\n\nIt seems that his son\u2019s illness ignited this realisation that he\u2019d become fixated on his own success. \u2018I don\u2019t have the stomach for it any more,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018The celebrity narcissism. I started to crumble. But then I started to wonder why I wanted to do this in the first place.\n\n'I\u2019d forgotten that it\u2019s about souls connecting, because I\u2019d become so anxious. There were people in my business life saying, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t done this or that, or you\u2019d written a better song, tickets might be selling quicker.\u201d\n\n'I started to take all that on board. No one wanted to take any responsibility.\n\n'It was much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was insecure enough already. I would digest it and say, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I\u2019m absolutely rubbish.\u201d\n\n'It affected me and I started to think, \u201cIt\u2019s all going to go. I\u2019m going to lose everything.\u201d\n\n\u2018I was insecure. I\u2019d been learning from my heroes for so many years, but even though I was learning with passion I was afraid I\u2019d become a mere poor-quality photocopy of my heroes.\n\n'But when I came back from this terrible time I realised I\u2019m not a mere photocopy. I\u2019ve learned everything I can from them, taken it and found it in my own soul, my own voice, my own style and now no critic can take that away.\n\n'It needed clarifying. Now I\u2019m just singing the music I love. Maybe when you let go, maybe that\u2019s when it comes back to you. Like love.\u2019\n\nMichael is overjoyed that he has a family of five now. Everything changed for him when his three-year relationship with his former girlfriend, the Golden Globe-nominated Devil Wears Prada actress Emily Blunt, fell apart.\n\nEverything changed for him when his three-year relationship with his former girlfriend, the Golden Globe-nominated Devil Wears Prada actress Emily Blunt, fell apart\n\nHe blamed himself for the break-up and went into therapy. He bought self-help books, readdressed his eating habits (he has a tendency to put on weight if he isn\u2019t careful) and started going to the gym.\n\nHe was still getting over Emily when he spotted Luisana after performing a show in Buenos Aires.\n\nThey met again at a party and he told her, \u2018You\u2019re my wife, you just don\u2019t know it yet. I\u2019m going to come back and marry you.\u2019\n\nA year went by with them exchanging emails, and as he told me when we last met in 2011, \u2018I was mad crazy for her. I went and asked her father\u2019s permission to marry her and we had a big, beautiful wedding.\u2019\n\nWhen he learned Noah was in remission, the joy returned to Michael\u2019s world. Is that when the urge to make music again hit him?\n\n\u2018The two are inextricably linked, yet it wasn\u2019t as straightforward as, \u201cMy son\u2019s recovered, I should make an album,\u201d\u2019 he explains. \u2018I\u2019d told my manager I wanted to take a ten-year sabbatical, so I could hang out and be bad.\n\nAfter that a year went by with them exchanging emails, and he said he was 'mad crazy for her'. Eventually, he asked her father for permission to marry her and they had a big wedding. Pictured are the couple in April 2018\n\n'But I missed the guys in my band. So once when Luisana had to go back to Argentina I said to them, \u201cCome over to the house, let\u2019s drink, order pizza, play video games and jam.\u201d\n\nThey came over, we partied and we said, \u201cLet\u2019s play some music.\u201d I thought, \u201cWow! This is fun.\u201d\u2019\n\nHe takes out his phone and shows me videos of his friends jamming in his house, playing the various songs that ended up being the new album. \u2018It was then that I realised I\u2019d missed making music. I didn\u2019t even know I\u2019d missed it. This was about a year ago.\u2019\n\nHe\u2019s starting to perk up now, and when his spirits lift he laughs easily and likes to make everyone around him laugh. As we chat he flits between accents \u2013 we go from Liverpool to Texas via India and South Africa, and finally to his version of a London accent, which he says he loves.\n\nIt was then that I realised I\u2019d missed making music. I didn\u2019t even know I\u2019d missed it. This was about a year ago\n\nHe\u2019s been working with James Corden on a Carpool Karaoke special for the Stand Up To Cancer fundraising campaign and likes the way Corden speaks. \u2018We watch The Gruffalo movie about five times a day because my kids love it, and James Corden is the voice of the little brown mouse, so he\u2019s in my house \u201call the day\u201d, as my little boy would say.\u2019\n\nHe pauses. \u2018There are three reasons I wanted to do this album,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018One, because I felt a debt of gratitude, deeper than I can explain, to the millions of people all over the world who prayed for us and showed us compassion. That gave me faith in humanity.\n\n'Two, because I love music and feel I can continue the legacy of my idols. And three, because if the world was ending \u2013 not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe break up \u2013 there\u2019s never a better time for music.\u2019\n\nThen suddenly he stops. \u2018This is my last interview,\u2019 he says quite solemnly. \u2018I\u2019m retiring from the business. I\u2019ve made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top.\u2019\n\nSomehow, though, I don\u2019t think he really means it.\n\nMichael\u2019s album Love will be released on 16 November.
