Now it\u2019s a lesson he\u2019s passing on to his own children.\n\nHis support of the community is nothing new.\n\nSoon after Trump wanted to ban trans soldiers from the movie, Corden did a number supporting trans troops.\n\nThe interview describes him as an LGBT ally and he said he has an affinity with the community. However, he\u2019s aware of his own privilege too.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve always looked different, not the societal ideal, but I\u2019ve never felt like an outsider to the extent that my gay friends have felt. It would be naive of me to think I have.\u2019", "images": ["https://gsn-iconic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/12/gsn-logo-invert.gif", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/12/gsn-logo-invert-scroll.png", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/logos/logo-li.svg", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/logos/logo-insta.svg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2edb694130462e9a6ad8436690e868db?s=156&d=mm&r=g", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/logos/logo-gsn.svg", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/logos/logo-youtube.svg", "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/03/James_Corden.jpg", "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2019/07/granny.jpg", "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2019/07/Forever-family.jpg", "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2019/07/Bryden_Michelle.jpg", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/logos/logo-twitter.svg", "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2016/11/anmarie_Calgaro.jpg", "https://gsn-iconic.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/logos/logo-facebook.svg", "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/03/Trump_Ad.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/03/James_Corden.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anya Crittenton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/james-corden-children-gay-relationships/", "title": "This is how James Corden would tell his children about gay relationships", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "Late night host James Corden has the best answer if his children ever ask him about gay relationships - and parents should take note.", "original-source": "https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/james-corden-children-gay-relationships/", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "This is how James Corden would tell his children about gay relationships", "description": "Late night host James Corden has the best answer if his children ever ask him about gay relationships - and parents should take note.", "url": "https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/james-corden-children-gay-relationships/", "site_name": "Gay Star News", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/03/James_Corden.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/03/James_Corden.jpg", "width": 851, "height": 551}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/GayStarNews", "tag": "Parenting", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-03-02T22:19:47+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Late night host James Corden has the best answer if his children ever ask him about gay relationships - and parents should take note.", "title": "This is how James Corden would tell his children about gay relationships", "site": "@gaystarnews", "image": "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2018/03/James_Corden.jpg", "creator": "@anyacrittenton"}, "fb": {"pages": 166622430080749}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/james-corden-children-gay-relationships/?ia_markup=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.gaystarnews.com/uploads/2020/01/cropped-0055_GSN_Favicon-01-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520029187.0, "source": "https://www.gaystarnews.com", "summary": ""}
