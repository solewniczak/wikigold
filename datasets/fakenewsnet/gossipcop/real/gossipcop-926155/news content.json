Catherine Zeta-Jones and her 14-year-old daughter with husband Michael Douglas, Carys Zeta Douglas, just had the most fashionable mother-daughter date night on Sunday, when they sat front row at the Dolce & Gabbana Alta Moda Fashion Show in N.Y.C.\n\nThe style spectacular was held inside the Metropolitan Opera, where guests ate a post-fashion show dinner on the Opera stage and the two were on-hand to experience it all. Catherine wore a curve-hugging black midi dress featuring a bodysuit style bodice with sheer sleeves and skirt, while Carys wore an off-the-shoulder floral-print crop top with high-waisted trousers. Both accessorized with hoop earrings and strappy sandals.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nThe two previously attended the Michael Kors spring 2018 fashion show together in September. And while Catherine did say that Carys and son Dylan both \u201cinherently love\u201d acting, the fact that Carys is already a fashion front row fixture, might mean modeling may not be far off.\n\nCelebrity Sightings in New York City - April 8, 2018 Credit: Gotham/GC Images\n\nThe brand is now notorious for filling its runways with young models from very famous celebrity families, but this time, they left it to the supermodel pros. Karlie Kloss opened the show wearing a stop-and-stare red gown covered in tiers of feathers, topped off with a feathery headpiece.\n\nAshley Graham walked in a ruched floral-print dress with ruffled sleeves.\n\nLegends Joan Smalls and Karen Elson both modeled strapless ballgowns with bustier bodices and full skirts covered in N.Y.C.-themed graffiti and images.\n\nMaye Musk, the 69-year-old model and mom to Elon Musk, walked in a two-toned sequin floor-length gown with a cap covered in bejeweled crystals, which Kloss captured on Instagram.\n\nmaye Credit: Karlie Kloss Instagram\n\nAnd Naomi Campbell closed the show wearing an oversize ball gown with N.Y.C. landmarks featured on the skirt and a Statue of Liberty-inspired crown.\n\nThere were also a number of other famous faces sitting front row including Diane Kruger, Dakota Fanning, Isabella Rossellini and Princes Diana\u2019s niece, Kitty Spencer.\n\nAnd if you thought this spectacle was over-the-top, wait until you see what Dolce & Gabbana did on Saturday night. The brand presented its Spring 2018 Alta Sartoria collection at the storied and glitzy Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fmaye-1-2000.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fcatherine-zeta-jones.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1280&h=640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fcatherine-zeta-jones.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1280&h=640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fcatherine-zeta-jones.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colleen Kratofil", "April"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/catherine-zeta-jones-daughter-attend-dolce-gabbana-fashion-show/", "title": "Catherine Zeta-Jones Brings Her Daughter Carys to Dolce & Gabbana Fashion Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Catherine Zeta-Jones,Fashion Shows,Karlie Kloss,Models,Naomi Campbell,News", "news_keywords": "Catherine Zeta-Jones,Fashion Shows,Karlie Kloss,Models,Naomi Campbell,News", "description": "Dolce & Gabbana took over N.Y.C. this weekend for a series of fabulous fashion shows", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Catherine Zeta-Jones Brings Her Daughter to the Dolce & Gabbana Fashion Show - Plus More Can't-Miss Moments", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/catherine-zeta-jones-daughter-attend-dolce-gabbana-fashion-show/", "description": "Dolce & Gabbana took over N.Y.C. this weekend for a series of fabulous fashion shows", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1280&h=640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fcatherine-zeta-jones.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 640}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/style/catherine-zeta-jones-daughter-attend-dolce-gabbana-fashion-show/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fcatherine-zeta-jones.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/style/catherine-zeta-jones-daughter-attend-dolce-gabbana-fashion-show/", "title": "Catherine Zeta-Jones Brings Her Daughter to the Dolce & Gabbana Fashion Show - Plus More Can't-Miss Moments", "description": "Dolce & Gabbana took over N.Y.C. this weekend for a series of fabulous fashion shows", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1280&h=640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fcatherine-zeta-jones.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/style/catherine-zeta-jones-daughter-attend-dolce-gabbana-fashion-show/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
