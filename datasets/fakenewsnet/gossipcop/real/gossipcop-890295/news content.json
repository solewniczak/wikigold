It\u2019s the reason that, for example, Daniel Bryan was referred to as \u201cBryan\u201d throughout the episodes of Total Bellas this past season, and why Carmella (for example) will be referred to as \u201cLeah.\u201d\n\nOur girl Nikki Bella, fresh off her ignoble exit from Dancing with the Stars (she was robbed, ROBBED we tell you!), will now serve as the executive producer of the hit E! show, because GET MONEY, NIKKI.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get right to the meat and potatoes of the season premiere (THE SEVENTH ONE, H8RZ!)\n\nWe kick off with Carmella, Naomi, and Nattie (Natalya) backstage at SmackDown Live, and a funny incident with Nattie\u2019s bra reminds us \u2014 again \u2014 that these women are human and hilarious.\n\nNatalya pointed out that this is the first time in the company\u2019s history that the \u201cwomen\u2019s revolution\u201d has taken over \u2014 for those of us who are old enough to remember, we\u2019ve come a long way from the days of Miss Elizabeth (RIP) and women wrestlers being little more than arm candy for the, uh, macho men of the ring. (See the success of the Netflix series GLOW for further evidence.)\n\nThe women find out that Money in the Bank will feature the first-ever women\u2019s ladder match, and Shane McMahon \u2014 the SmackDown commissioner \u2014 confirmed it.\n\nThen, Total Divas takes off to Pensacola, FL, where we see Naomi (Trinity) come home to her husband, Jimmy Uso (Jon). (Really, who better than other wrestlers to marry each other\u2026)\n\nYou can tell, though, that the two of them aren\u2019t used to being alphas \u2014 even though they\u2019ve been married for three years \u2014 because they spat about who\u2019s going to be the one to start dinner, and, per Trinity, the \u201cromance department\u201d is very lacking. (With the way they carry their belts around all the time, you have to wonder if they even wear their belts in bed\u2026)\n\nSo, Jon decides that they\u2019re going to go to dinner to a drive-through, because apparently, they\u2019re 15 years old. He even went so far as to suggest that Trinity get \u201cdrive-through spaghetti,\u201d which sounds as nasty as it looks. We\u2019re with Trinity on this one \u2014 adults need to go out to dinner to a place that doesn\u2019t have pictures on the menu.\n\nIn the next Total Divas segment, Brie is playing with baby Birdie \u2014 who is the spitting image of her father, Daniel Bryan. We see a preview of Winston\u2019s butt \u2014 whom, you will recall from this past season of Total Bellas, was the subject of a much-contested Puppy Custody battle between Brie and her twin sister, Nikki \u2014 and Bryan, who comes in and volunteers that he\u2019ll be able to change baby Birdie if needed. Brie tells us that Bryan has received paternity leave, which she finds to be remarkable (even though many larger companies, today, offer fathers paternity leave in the same way they offer mothers maternity leave).\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s Nikki who ends up feeding her niece, which is the perfect segue into her Total Divas segment, where she talks about her neck, her back, and\u2026her engagement. (Was your mind in the gutter again?)\n\nNikki thinks that she would be a good substitute as GM on SmackDown, especially since Bryan is out on paternity leave, and especially since she can\u2019t participate in the Money in the Bank ladder match.\n\nWe then switch over to the Monday Night Raw camp, where we see Maryse, Alexa Bliss \u2014 who, impressively, is the first woman to be both the Raw and the SmackDown woman\u2019s champion \u2014 and Nia Jax, who is a cousin of The Rock (as is, apparently, half of the WWE roster). Maryse is still trying to get to know her new teammates on the Raw roster, but she seems to be holding her own and making friends with everyone. Nia Jax, too, is doing her part to make Maryse feel comfortable.\n\nMaryse, for her part, feels \u201cdifferent\u201d as a result of her shift from active Diva wrestler to Miz manager (the poor dear), but she still sees herself as a \u201csuccess\u201d with the company.\n\nBack in Pensacola, Trinity and Jon are on a romantic date to a historic lighthouse in the area, adding a bit of romance to an otherwise terrible date (seriously, DRIVE THROUGH SPAGHETTI? That doesn\u2019t even sound good!).\n\nWe then move on to Rusev and Lana\u2019s Total Divas segment, and the first thing we notice is that Lana\u2019s \u201cRussian\u201d accent has disappeared, in place of a Valley Girl California accent. (Rusev\u2019s accent is still intact, however, though not as exaggerated as when he\u2019s in the ring.) Lana\u2019s moving from being Rusev\u2019s manager to being a Diva all on her own, and needless to say, she\u2019s struggling. (What, the \u201cpink wedding cake\u201d incident with Roman \u201cBae\u201d Reigns wasn\u2019t enough for you?)\n\nThe next part of the show features a special guest appearance by Nattie\u2019s dad, Jim \u201cThe Anvil\u201d Neihardt (#CALLBACK to the WWF!). She needed some advice on her first-ever ladder match, especially since she would be part of a historic ladder match (being that it\u2019s the first ever, all-women\u2019s Money in the Bank ladder match), but \u201cThe Anvil\u201d assures her that it\u2019s \u201ceasy peasy,\u201d though he may be biased, since he\u2019s been in ladder matches from a time before the WWE was even in existence. Watching Nattie train with \u201cThe Anvil,\u201d while funny, is also another nice #CALLBACK to WWF fans.\n\nBack in Pensacola, Jon takes Trinity to \u201cLa Restaurante Uso,\u201d which is basically little more than an excuse for Jon to stay home and cook for his dearly beloved. However, as Trinity rightly points out, it\u2019s the fact that Jon keeps \u201ctrying\u201d that matters to her, and Jon points out that it\u2019s the \u201cthought\u201d that counts when it comes to a gift for his wife.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s later revealed that Jon had it all catered out, rather than cook the meal itself, but it doesn\u2019t matter, because it\u2019s a cute moment for the couple.\n\nBack in the Bella house, the Danielson family is having a nice family moment when Bryan springs on Brie that he has to go to Toronto for work. Needless to say, Brie takes it as well as you think she would, but eventually accepts that \u201cshe\u2019s got it\u201d because Bryan gave her the confidence as a mother to feel as such.\n\nA week before Money in the Bank, Nikki has a pre-event pool party (which is really hilarious to watch, considering how, outside of Total Divas, these women tear each other\u2019s hair out \u2014 usually, reality shows are the other way around, in that real life is very fun, while the show is exaggeratingly dramatic, but that\u2019s what makes this show fun).\n\nNikki and Nattie give Lana the best advice they have \u2014 with Nikki recalling her WrestleMania win \u2014 while also reminding Rusev that she\u2019s not going to do anything that makes her hurt herself.\n\nThe season premiere of Total Divas closes out with the girls walking to the Money in the Bank ring (dun dun duuuuun!), where surely, in the next episode, we will see who goes home with MONEY.
