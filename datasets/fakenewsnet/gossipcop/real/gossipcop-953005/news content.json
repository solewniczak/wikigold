{"url": "https://people.com/royals/prince-george-fifth-birthday-coin/", "text": "The Royal Mint just announced that in honor of George\u2019s birthday on July 22, it will issue a \u00a35 (about $6.50) commemorative coin, available to the public for purchase. The coin features an image of St. George, the patron saint of England, and a dragon. According to legend, the dragon, who lived nearby St. George\u2019s town, would attack the locals, so St. George, a knight, tamed and killed it. The coin, also embossed with the year 2018, is part of a Royal Mint annual set called The Progress of a Prince.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fchristening1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fprince-george-2-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fprince-george-1-3.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1560&h=780&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fprince-george-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1560&h=780&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fprince-george-1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maura Hohman", "July"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/royals/prince-george-fifth-birthday-coin/", "title": "Prince George Just Received His First Official Birthday Present Ahead of His Big Day", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "British Royals,News,Prince George", "news_keywords": "British Royals,News,Prince George", "description": "Prince George is turning 5 on Sunday, and the Royal Mint released a commemorative coin with St. George and the dragon for the occasion.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Prince George Just Received His First Official Birthday Present Ahead of His Big Day", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/royals/prince-george-fifth-birthday-coin/", "description": "Prince George is turning 5 on Sunday, and the Royal Mint released a commemorative coin with St. George and the dragon for the occasion.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1560&h=780&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fprince-george-1-2000.jpg", "width": 1560, "height": 780}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/royals/prince-george-fifth-birthday-coin/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fprince-george-1-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/royals/prince-george-fifth-birthday-coin/", "title": "Prince George Just Received His First Official Birthday Present Ahead of His Big Day", "description": "Prince George is turning 5 on Sunday, and the Royal Mint released a commemorative coin with St. George and the dragon for the occasion.", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1560&h=780&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fprince-george-1-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/royals/prince-george-fifth-birthday-coin/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
