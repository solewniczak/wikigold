They pointed toward a scene where Taylor's wearing a black leotard and standing flanked by male backup dancers in a mansion, which they compared to a scene from Beyonc\u00e9's \"Formation\" video, Buzzfeed reports.\n\nJoseph Kahn, the director of the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" video, responded to the accusations in a tweet on Friday. \"I\u2019ve worked with Beyonc\u00e9 a few times. She\u2019s an amazing person. The #LWYMMDvideo is not in her art space. Love and respect to Bey,\" he wrote. Kahn's likely referring to his work with Destiny Child on their \"Say My Name\" and \"Jumpin\u2019 Jumpin\" videos. He's also directed a number of other Taylor Swift videos, including the one for \"Bad Blood,\" Just Jared Jr. reports.\n\nThe entire \"Look What You Made Me Do\" video will premiere Sunday at the VMAs. Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 haven't commented on the comparisons.\n\nRelated: Taylor Swift's Label Responds to Accusations of Shading Kanye With Her Album\n\nCheck This Out:", "images": ["https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59a2da98e4a35a2393d11225/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-social.png"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59a2da98e4a35a2393d11225/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-social.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Suzannah Weiss"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-video-beyonce-comparisons", "title": "Taylor Swift Video Director Responds to Accusations of Copying Beyonc\u00e9", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "After Taylor Swift dropped a teaser for her \"Look What You Made Me Do\" video, people accused her of ripping off Beyonc\u00e9.", "id": "59a2d355e4a35a2393d11223", "keywords": "taylor swift,beyonc\u00e9", "news_keywords": "taylor swift,beyonc\u00e9", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59a2d355e4a35a2393d11223", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"After Taylor Swift dropped a teaser for her \\\"Look What You Made Me Do\\\" video, people accused her of ripping off Beyonc\u00e9.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59a2dac2d739f73884846ce8/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/taylor-swift-tout.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59a2dac2d739f73884846ce8/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/taylor-swift-tout.png\"}", "og": {"description": "\"Love and respect to Bey.\"", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59a2da98e4a35a2393d11225/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-social.png", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "The \"Look What You Made Me Do\" Video's Director Responded to Accusations of Copying Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-video-beyonce-comparisons"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-08-27T14:52:35.988Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59a2da98e4a35a2393d11225/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-social.png?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503845555.988, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
