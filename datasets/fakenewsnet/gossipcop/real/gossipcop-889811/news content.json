Let the games begin!\n\nIn the anime-inspired visual, Taylor Swift plays with themes seen in sci-fi films such as Tron and Blade Runner as well as Ghost in the Shell, specifically Major Motoko\u2019s cyborg shell. A little bit of the video game franchise Final Fantasy, perhaps?\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nAnd the latest Joseph Kahn-directed footage even contains follow-up references originally made in the \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d video as well as her past music videos. (Proof that the old Taylor Swift is alive and well!)\n\n1. Shout-outs to Boyfriend Joe Alwyn\n\nLook closely in the opening scenes and you\u2019ll find the number 89 \u2013 a nod to her birth year and album title, 1989. And what\u2019s that 91 in yellow? It could be Alwyn\u2019s birth year: 1991.\n\nAfter all, she does sing: \u201cKnew he was a killer/ First time that I saw him.\u201d Alwyn\u2019s first-ever movie was last year\u2019s Billy Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk, in which he starred as a U.S. soldier stricken with PTSD after a deadly firefight during the Iraq war.\n\nAnother shout-out to Alwyn: The name \u201cJoseph\u201d is in Chinese calligraphy at 0:28. Or could it be for the director?\n\n2. The Snake Is Back\n\nDon\u2019t think the snake references are gone! Swift slyly included \u201cYear of the Snake\u201d (\u86c7\u5e74) in Chinese calligraphy seen in one of the alleyways (at 0:22).\n\nSwift has been embracing the snake image and using it to promote her new music, most prominently in \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d with a CGI snake. In addition, she\u2019 is selling slithering merchandise in support of her upcoming Reputation album.\n\nAnd remember her feud with Kim Kardashian West? The reality star previously banned commenters from using the snake emoji on her Instagram, and instead was flooded with the reptile in the comment sections.\n\n3. Secret Messages Hiding on the Walls\n\nThe star sends messages to her Swifties with affirmations on the wall as well as her favorite number, 13.\n\nThere\u2019s even a reference to the latest single off of Reputation: \u201cGorgeous.\u201d\n\n4. Breaking Free from the Media\u2019s Perception\n\nThe glass box that cyborg Taylor is trapped in could be how Swift sees herself against the media.\n\nA possible meaning to the \u201c\u2026Ready for It?\u201d music video: Taylor is the only person to defeat Taylor.\n\nAll those luminescent lightning bolts could be to refresh everyone\u2019s memory about her songwriting collaboration with ex-boyfriend Harris for the 2016 single with Rihanna \u201cThis Is What You Came For.\u201d The lightning bolts are clear references to the single\u2019s cover art and the line, \u201clighting strikes every time you move\u201d and that color scheme is definitely similar.\n\nAnd remember Nils Sj\u00f6berg? Swifties think the singer\u2019s cyborg (cy-berg) getup could possibly be a nod to the pseudonym Swift used for writing credit on \u201cThis Is What You Came For.\u201d\n\nKahn also joked about the fake name on Twitter Thursday, writing: \u201cNils Sj\u00f6bot.\u201d\n\n6. Old and New Taylor\n\nThough in \u201c\u2026Ready for It?\u201d it\u2019s clear that Swift is battling herself, there are references to her old music videos.\n\nSwift has collaborated with Kahn for \u201cBlank Space,\u201d \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d and \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d Fans noticed similarities in some of the poses from \u201c\u2026Ready for It\u201d in two of Kahn\u2019s past Swift videos: \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d and \u201cBad Blood.\u201d\n\nIn addition, \u201cBad Blood\u201d and \u201c\u2026Ready for It?\u201d both featured futuristic themes throughout the videos with similar choreography.\n\n7. White Horse\n\nKeeping with the theory that Swift has revisited many of her past music videos, the Grammy winner also features a white horse, a possible hint to her 2008 track \u201cWhite Horse\u201d off the Fearless album.\n\nAlso Swift rode a white stallion in her \u201cBlank Space\u201d video.\n\n8. Gold Plane from \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d\n\nObservant fans found in one scene, Swift stands on what resembles a platform that reads \u201cburn all the witches\u201d in spray paint that resembles the plane from the \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d video.\n\n9. Makeup\n\nSwift\u2019s makeup, specifically the winged eyeliner is very similar to that of her \u201cBlank Space\u201d character. And the red lipstick is back too!\n\nTaylor Swift's '...
