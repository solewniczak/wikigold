Stop. I\u2019m live,\u201d Daddario replied.\n\nSherwood, 27, posted a video on Instagram apologizing for his behavior calling it \u201cdisgusting and abhorrent.\u201d Daddario stands beside him in the video but doesn\u2019t speak during Sherwood\u2019s apology.\n\n\u201cI think so many problematic phrases go unchallenged and they perpetuate negativity and hate and intolerance, and today I was part of that and I am truly, truly sorry,\u201d Sherwood says in the video.\n\nDaddario closes out the video stating that the cast and crew of \u201cShadowhunters\u201d stands for \u201clove and kindness.\u201d\n\nWatch below.", "images":
