People doing stuff like that is great.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s weird for me \u2014 everyone should just be who they want to be. It\u2019s tough to justify somebody having to answer to someone else about stuff like that.\u201d In 2013, Styles shot down rumors that he was bisexual in an interview with British GQ.\n\nStyles, who is rumored to be dating London-based chef and food blogger Tess Ward, was tight-lipped when it came to sharing details about his current love life (except he admits that he\u2019s not on Tinder).\n\n\u201cI try not to overthink too much. I don\u2019t really talk about it I guess. The rollercoaster affects different people in different ways. One of the ways that helps me dealing with that is compartmentalizing between working,\u201d he shared. \u201cAll that stuff for me, is just a different thing.\u201d\n\nAs to whether Styles is still friends with any of his famous ex-girlfriends, including Taylor Swift and Kendall Jenner, he said with a wry smile, \u201cEveryone should be friends, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just learn,\u201d he said about whether he feels burned from his past high-profile relationships. \u201cIt\u2019s part of growing up.\u201d\n\nFROM COINAGE: 7 Most Expensive Music Videos\n\nStyles has a lot to celebrate after the release of his highly anticipated self-titled debut solo album on Friday, but he remembers avoiding the party scene as he first shot to fame as a member of One Direction.\n\n\u201cOn the first couple of tours it was so exciting as we\u2019d have a drink and go to parties,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for me, the albums got higher so they become harder to sing so I knew if I didn\u2019t come off stage and go to bed I wouldn\u2019t be able to sing the next night. Also, it\u2019s just not for me. I\u2019d rather wake up with a clear head. I\u2019m not straight edge or anything. I\u2019ll celebrate and hang out with friends when it\u2019s the right time.\u201d\n\nThough Styles\u2019 former band mates Zayn Malik and Niall Horan also have embarked on their own solo projects, he has an open mind about the possibility of the band reuniting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I would never rule out doing,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now everyone\u2019s getting a chance to explore things they want to try and it\u2019s really cool to see what they\u2019re coming up with when it\u2019s just them in a studio writing.\u201d", "images":
