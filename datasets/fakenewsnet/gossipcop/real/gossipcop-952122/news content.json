They want to deliver something bigger and better than last year. I think it\u2019s going to be a fantastic season. It will be worth the wait.\u201d\n\nAfter Holland\u2019s panel, she noted that the show will have more special effects work than previous seasons as well. \u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting season, just takes a little more time,\u201d she said.\n\nThe show has already released a sly teaser trailer, with a commercial for a new Hawkins mall:\n\nStranger Things joins several fan-favorite shows that are skipping 2018, such as HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones, Veep and True Detective, along with FX\u2019s Fargo and Adult Swim\u2019s Rick and Morty.", "images":
