Brady shuns white sugar, white flour, nightshade vegetables (tomatoes, eggplant, mushrooms), most fruits, caffeine, MSG, iodized salt (pink Himalayan only) and dairy\n\nArticle content A loyal Patriots fan, Timothy Caulfield recently confessed in Policy Options Magazine that, should the seriously \u201cdreamy\u201d Tom Brady ever need a kidney, \u201cI\u2019m there for him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 2 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content But not even Brady\u2019s epic Super Bowl win is enough to make Caulfield question whether he\u2019s been wrong all along about the quarterback\u2019s freakishly restricted diet, certain elements of which, writes Caulfield, holder of the University of Alberta\u2019s Canada research chair in health law and policy, \u201cregister as full out kook.\u201d We apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Is Tom Brady's diet \u2014 no nightshades or fruit \u2014 the secret behind his success? Back to video Brady and his supermodel wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen reportedly follow an 80-per-cent alkaline, 20-per-cent acidic diet \u2014 a meal plan the NFL quarterback famously told Sports Illustrated in 2014 provides \u201cbalance and harmony through my metabolic system.\u201d Brady shuns white sugar, white flour, nightshade vegetables (tomatoes, eggplant, mushrooms), most fruits (\u201cI\u2019ve never eaten a strawberry in my life,\u201d he told New York magazine last year), caffeine, MSG, iodized salt (pink Himalayan only) and dairy.\n\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content He does enjoy avocado-based ice cream. The \u201cageless wonder\u201d quarterback credits his insanely disciplined diet for his success and, at 39, says he has no plans for retiring (\u201cToo bad babe,\u201d he reportedly told B\u00fcndchen when she asked him to hang up his jersey after the Patriot\u2019s stunning comeback Sunday, \u201cI\u2019m having too much fun.\u201d) But is there any science to support his austere eating plan? \u201cHe\u2019s such a good example of an anecdote overwhelming the data,\u201d Caulfield says. \u201cAnd the media usually give him the \u2018you-can\u2019t-argue-with success\u2019 treatment.\u201d Parts of Brady\u2019s diet are undoubtedly healthy, Caulfield allows. He\u2019s eating more \u201creal\u201d food. He avoids junk food. All good, he says. \u201cBut what often happens with these fad diets is, a little bit of good is wrapped in a blanket of pseudoscience, and the whole package is sold even though there\u2019s no data to support it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content Brady appears to subscribe to an alkaline diet popularized by Robert O. Young, author of \u201cThe pH Miracle\u201d book series. Young is an American naturopath now facing three years and eight months in a California jail for practising medicine without a licence. According to the BBC, he bought his PhD from a diploma mill. The alkaline view is based on the (scientifically discredited) theory people need to consume a diet high in alkaline foods in order to maintain the pH of the blood. If blood becomes too acidic, the hypothesis holds, the body starts leaching calcium and other minerals from the bones, muscles and major organs, and bad things start to happen. Dr. Rena Mendelson begs to differ. Our bodies naturally control our pH levels, says Mendelson, a professor in the school of nutrition at Ryerson University in Toronto.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content \u201cIt\u2019s not something we even need to be conscious of, because our normal homeostatic mechanisms allow us to adapt to a range of different foods or fluids or whatever it is we consume,\u201d she says. \u201cHow would the rest of us be walking around and performing well in our day-to-day life if we had to pay attention to the acidity or alkalinity of the foods we consume?\u201d If I had Tom Brady\u2019s personal chef I would eat healthy, too There\u2019s nothing wrong with a diet that\u2019s high in vegetables and whole grain. Eliminating any one food also isn\u2019t a problem, Mendelson says. Strawberries aren\u2019t essential to the diet. Neither are tomatoes. But tossing out an entire food group \u2014 nightshades, for example \u2014 can be problematic. Nightshades are high in nutrients, high in the proven Mediterranean diet and are actually anti-inflammatory, says Calgary University registered dietician and epidemiologist Tanis Fenton.\n\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content We don\u2019t need pure sugar. But neither do we need to cut out fruit because it has sugar, she says. Photo by Eric Gay / AP Last year, Fenton published a systematic review of the association between diet acidic load, and cancer. Her conclusion: \u201cAlmost no actual research\u201d exists to prove or disprove these diets for cancer prevention or treatment. Brady is a phenomenal athlete, Fenton says. \u201cAnd he very modestly is suggesting his diet is the reason, but, no. That\u2019s not good evidence, because it\u2019s a case study \u2013 it\u2019s one individual, and an individual endowed with a wonderful genetic predisposition to be an athlete, obviously. Because diet alone doesn\u2019t make us phenomenal athletes like him.\u201d Still, Caulfield\u2019s research has shown people subscribe to celebrities over any other source of authority. Celebrity trumps everything.\n\nAdvertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content More On This Topic Tom Brady can prompt complicated feelings, but there is no doubt about his football legacy World\u2019s most prolific runner jogs every day for over 52 years, finally decides to take a break Crickets are a hot new source of protein \u2014 but their real value could lie in the poop they produce Brady isn\u2019t alone: Think of swimmer Michael Phelps\u2019 embrace of \u201ccupping\u201d at the Rio games, and super-cold cryotherapy devotee LeBron James. There\u2019s a sociological phenomenon that suggests we can\u2019t help, consciously or not, be influenced by celebrities, Caulfield says. \u201cWe\u2019re all comparison machines \u2014 we can\u2019t help but compare ourselves to others. For most of human history that was a pretty small cohort. Now it\u2019s people like Tom Brady.\u201d \u201cThey have such huge cultural footprint \u2014 they own social media, they own popular culture. We can\u2019t help but hear the things they talk about.\u201d But he worries the pseudoscience noise complicates the story about how to live a healthy lifestyle. \u201cIt makes it sound like eating healthy is hard and expensive. People will go, \u201cif I had Tom Brady\u2019s personal chef I would eat healthy, too.\u2019 And that\u2019s a terrible message,\u201d he says. \u201cEating healthy doesn\u2019t have to be complicated.\u201d\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nNP Posted Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the National Post, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.
