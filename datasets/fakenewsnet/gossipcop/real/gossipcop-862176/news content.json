I\u2019m with her because I like her and I hope she\u2019s with me because she likes me. When we come home, we don\u2019t really talk about that shit. We just spend time together as a normal couple, cook food, watch TV, have a laugh.\u201d\n\nZayn has previously talked about how he finds fame a difficult thing to manage, especially when coupled with his anxiety. And in this interview, the \u201cPillowtalk\u201d singer again discussed how he copes with the loss of anonymity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anywhere I could be anonymous now,\u201d he shared. \u201cIn New York [where Gigi is based], you can sometimes get out in the early hours of the morning for a walk. But there\u2019s no underground parking here [in London], no escape routes. So they\u2019re going to get pictures, they\u2019re going to find you. In LA [his own usual US base], it\u2019s more catered to these things \u2014 you\u2019ve got back entrances and that.\u201d\n\nLuckily for Zayn, it seems that Gigi doesn\u2019t mind staying in and relaxing. In fact, the model has taken on some of his Britishism, including a love of pies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got into a thing of cooking pies recently,\u201d he revealed. \u201cI cook a mean chicken and sweetcorn pie, with Alfredo sauce. I make my own pastry, roll it out and everything.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F20%2Fsex-anxiety-tout.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F02%2F09%2FSwimsuits.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/misc/300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=600&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F06%2F21%2FZayn_Malik.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F17%2Fboob-sweat.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Fyuliya-kosolapova-bqirdOGHvYQ-unsplash-e1573767747444.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F07%2F08%2Fchiron-retrograde-2021.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F06%2F08%2Ffriendquestions-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fdream_about_ex.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=600&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F06%2F21%2FZayn_Malik.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alim Kheraj", "Updated Jun"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/zayn-malik-says-doesnt-consider-gigi-hadid-power-couple/", "title": "Zayn Malik doesn't want you to call him and Gigi Hadid a \"power couple\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Bella Hadid,gigi hadid", "news_keywords": "Bella Hadid,gigi hadid", "description": "Zayn Malik wants you to know that he truly likes Gigi, and that he even bakes her pies.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Zayn Malik doesn't want you to call him and Gigi Hadid a \"power couple\"", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/zayn-malik-says-doesnt-consider-gigi-hadid-power-couple/", "description": "Zayn Malik wants you to know that he truly likes Gigi, and that he even bakes her pies.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=600&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F06%2F21%2FZayn_Malik.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/zayn-malik-says-doesnt-consider-gigi-hadid-power-couple/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F06%2F21%2FZayn_Malik.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/zayn-malik-says-doesnt-consider-gigi-hadid-power-couple/", "title": "Zayn Malik doesn't want you to call him and Gigi Hadid a \"power couple\"", "description": "Zayn Malik wants you to know that he truly likes Gigi, and that he even bakes her pies.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=600&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F06%2F21%2FZayn_Malik.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/zayn-malik-says-doesnt-consider-gigi-hadid-power-couple/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
