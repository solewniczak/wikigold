On Tuesday, USA Network officially announced that original Suits cast member Meghan Markle is leaving the legal drama at the end of season 7. The word arrives a day after news broke of her engagement to Prince Harry of Wales.\n\nThis certainly doesn\u2019t come as a surprise. Two weeks ago, it was reported that she and fellow original cast member Patrick J. Adams would depart once their contracts were up at the end of the upcoming season, and Markle noted in her joint interview with Prince Harry that she was leaving acting behind. There is no word yet if Adams will remain past season 7.\n\nFor the past seven seasons, Markle played the tenacious Rachel Zane, an ambitious paralegal who eventually became a full fledged lawyer at the show\u2019s central law firm. Along the way, Rachel began dating and eventually got engaged to the firm\u2019s wonder-boy, Mike Ross (Adams).\n\nUSA Network and Universal Cable Productions released the following statement: \u201cFrom all of us at USA Network and Universal Cable Productions, we want to send our most heartfelt congratulations to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on their engagement. Meghan has been a member of our family for seven years and it has been a joy to work with her. We want to thank her for her undeniable passion and dedication to Suits, and we wish her the very best.\u201d\n\nThe seventh season of Suits will resume in 2018.", "images":
