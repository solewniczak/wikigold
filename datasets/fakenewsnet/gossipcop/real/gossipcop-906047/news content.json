At the podium, she thanked Donatella Versace for the gown she was wearing and gave a little wink before giving a little lip service to Michael B. Jordan.\n\n\"I can't imagine my life without you. I love you to pieces. I can't wait to see you guys on tour,\" she said to her fans, before adding, \"Shout out to Michael B. Jordan because he's going to be taking this [dress] off of me tonight.\"\n\nThe Kardashians Came Out in Full Force\n\nKardashian Jenner 2018 E! People's Choice Awards Credit: Todd Williamson/E!
