Reprising his role, Josh Gad will be voicing Olaf in Frozen 2. But unfortunately, his two girls \u2014 Ava and Isabella \u2014 aren\u2019t really impressed. Perhaps they\u2019re not yet old enough to realize that Gad has such an incredibly cool career.\n\nGad spoke with E! News when he joked that his daughters changed the subject in response to the sequel.\n\n\"'Daddy, I want more cereal,'\" Gad said when asked about their response. \"They're not interested in what I'm doing.\"\n\nHowever, there may be a pretty sweet reason behind it. According to Gad, he reads to his children at night (which is incredible) and one of the books in the rotation is directly related to Frozen. And since nobody does the Olaf voice better than he does, he often treats them to stories recited by Olaf himself.\n\nSo with that happening on a nightly basis, it makes sense that the sequel wouldn\u2019t be big news.\n\n\"They get it firsthand,\" Gad stated. \"So, for them, every day is a sequel for them.\"\n\nQuite frankly, we\u2019re a little jealous. Maybe Gad\u2019s next career move could be professional storytelling.\n\nWhile he said that his kids do enjoy Frozen (and are legitimately looking forward to the sequel), he admitted that there are two other movies that are taking their attention at the moment.\n\n\"Right now, they're really into Captain Underpants and Sing\" he said.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F02%2F09%2FSwimsuits.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Fyuliya-kosolapova-bqirdOGHvYQ-unsplash-e1573767747444.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/misc/300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F07%2F08%2Fchiron-retrograde-2021.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2016%2F07%2F27%2Fkarenbelz-300x225-1.jpeg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fdream_about_ex.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=985&h=493&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F09%2F26%2Fjosh-gad-olaf.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F06%2F08%2Ffriendquestions-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F17%2Fboob-sweat.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F20%2Fsex-anxiety-tout.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=985&h=493&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F09%2F26%2Fjosh-gad-olaf.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Belz", "Updated Sep"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/josh-gad-revealed-what-his-kids-thought-of-frozen-2/", "title": "Josh Gad revealed what his kids thought of \"Frozen 2\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Josh Gad got real about what daughters Ava and Isabella think about the upcoming \"Frozen\" sequel.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Josh Gad revealed what his kids thought of \"Frozen 2\"", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/josh-gad-revealed-what-his-kids-thought-of-frozen-2/", "description": "Josh Gad got real about what daughters Ava and Isabella think about the upcoming \"Frozen\" sequel.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=985&h=493&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F09%2F26%2Fjosh-gad-olaf.jpg", "width": 985, "height": 493}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/josh-gad-revealed-what-his-kids-thought-of-frozen-2/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F09%2F26%2Fjosh-gad-olaf.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/josh-gad-revealed-what-his-kids-thought-of-frozen-2/", "title": "Josh Gad revealed what his kids thought of \"Frozen 2\"", "description": "Josh Gad got real about what daughters Ava and Isabella think about the upcoming \"Frozen\" sequel.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=985&h=493&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F09%2F26%2Fjosh-gad-olaf.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/josh-gad-revealed-what-his-kids-thought-of-frozen-2/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
