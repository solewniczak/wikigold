The answer is not what he wanted\n\nUpdate, January 23rd, 2020, 5:30 p.m. ET: The 62nd annual Grammy Awards will air on Sunday, January 26th on CBS at 5:00 p.m. PT. The 2020 Grammy Awards will be hosted by Alicia Keys at Los Angeles\u2019 Staples Center. Kanye West has won 21 Grammys and he\u2019s been nominated 69 times. West doesn\u2019t have any 2020 Grammys nominations, but he was nominated for Producer Of The Year, Non-Classical in 2019.\n\nTo say Kanye West has a complicated relationship with the Grammy Awards is an understatement. The two seem to have a love/hate relationship with each other, and we\u2019re just spectators along for the ride. While it often seems like West isn\u2019t a big fan of the show \u2014 there\u2019s no indication he\u2019ll attend this year, and he hasn\u2019t attended in recent years\u2014it\u2019s still a fact that he is one of the top Grammy winners of all time. So how many Grammy awards does Kanye West actually have?\n\nJudging by his obvious dislike of the awards show, one might assume West has been snubbed a few too many times. This is true in a way, but again: West has won more Grammys than most music artists. At the moment, he has a record 21 awards, with a staggering 68 nominations. That\u2019s impressive!\n\nThe last time West won an award was in 2012, when he snagged three: Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song for \u201cN****s In Paris,\u201d and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \u201cNo Church In The Wild.\u201d He received the most wins at the 2007 and 2011 shows, and the most nominations in 2016.\n\nSo what\u2019s the deal with the Kanye West/Grammy Awards controversy?\n\nIt started in the early 2000s, when his work was overlooked by the Recording Academy, and the situation worsened when he lost Best New Artist to Maroon 5 at the 2005 show. West has always felt that he\u2019s been snubbed at the Grammys, and this feeling grew when his critically lauded album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy wasn\u2019t nominated for Album Of The Year.\n\nAt the same time, though, he makes it seem like he doesn\u2019t care whether he wins or loses. In 2009, during an interview with a radio show, West said, \u201cI actually don\u2019t want to win any more Grammys. Because I have 10, and that\u2019s a perfect number. I don\u2019t want to have 11 Grammys. That fucks my number up.\u201d\n\nWest has boycotted the Grammys several times before \u2014 once because Frank Ocean wasn\u2019t nominated, and another time in 2013 when he was in Brazil.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F20%2Fsex-anxiety-tout.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F02%2F09%2FSwimsuits.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/misc/300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=750&h=375&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2020%2F01%2F23%2Fkanye_west.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F17%2Fboob-sweat.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Fyuliya-kosolapova-bqirdOGHvYQ-unsplash-e1573767747444.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F01%2F05%2FJessicaBooth1-300x225-1.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F07%2F08%2Fchiron-retrograde-2021.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F06%2F08%2Ffriendquestions-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fdream_about_ex.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=750&h=375&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2020%2F01%2F23%2Fkanye_west.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Booth", "Updated Jan"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/kanye-west-how-many-grammys/", "title": "How Many Grammy Awards Does Kanye West Have?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "grammys", "news_keywords": "grammys", "description": "Has Kanye West ever won a Grammy before?
