{"url": "https://www.allure.com/story/rihanna-summer-bob", "text": "In today's critically important beauty news: RIHANNA HAS A BOB.\n\nThe Fenty Beauty mogul hopped on this summer's trend of \"short hair, don't care\" and chopped off her hair. She posted a story to Instagram fluffing a textured, angled bob, and it's good.\n\nInstead of a blunt bob, Rihanna opted for an asymmetrical cut, which gave her more length in the back, while the front pieces hit an inch above her chin. She parted the look on the side for added volume. Leave it to Rihanna to add an entirely new twist to a style that's been flooding our feeds all summer long.\n\nIn the shot, she's also showing off one of the new looks from her Savage x Fenty line \u2014 a candy-apple-red bra. She paired it with some purple cat-eye sunglasses to complete the look, perfect for end-of-July heat.\n\nIn fairness, RiRi changes up her hair almost as frequently as she changes her heels, though for the past few months she's been wearing it long. Historically, she's experimented with almost every shade of the rainbow, including blue, blonde, and gray, and has worn long hair to her waist, as well as shaved her head. Most recently, she was spotted in a lace-front blonde wig.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThis season, \"short hair\" has pretty much become synonymous with \"summer beauty.\" Stars, including Jessica Chastain, Emma Roberts, and Lucy Hale, have all made the chop. Hell, even earlier this week Alicia Keys cut it all off, debuting a '90s-inspired pixie cut that rendered her almost unrecognizable.", "images": ["https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b59f24ee2fd29332e67b3ef/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/rihanna-haircut-bob.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b59f24ee2fd29332e67b3ef/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/rihanna-haircut-bob.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b59f24ee2fd29332e67b3ef/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/rihanna-haircut-bob.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Zoe Weiner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/rihanna-summer-bob", "title": "Rihanna Debuts New Bob Haircut for Summer", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Fenty Beauty Mogul Rihanna cut her hair into a bob, and showed off one of her new Savage x Fenty styles in the process.
