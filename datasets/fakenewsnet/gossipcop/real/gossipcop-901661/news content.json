Before his death in 2003, the alleged Bufalino crime family member claimed to have killed Teamster leader Jimmy Hoffa (played by Pacino) on the orders of mob boss Russell Bufalino.\n\nDe Niro confirmed that the height difference was the reason for the towering platforms on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in April, saying they made the shoes to give him more inches in height. \u201cThe guy [Sheeran] was actually much taller \u2014 about five, six inches taller than me \u2014 so [the shoes] were to show the relation to any of the other actors or characters that I\u2019m taller.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F248515971_423792849226570_1672372709981615183_n.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Frobert-de-niro-1-1-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Frobert-de-niro-2-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1481&h=741&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Frobert-de-niro-1-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1481&h=741&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Frobert-de-niro-1-1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn", "April"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/robert-de-niro-platform-shoes-al-pacino-the-irishman/", "title": "Robert De Niro Wears Platform Shoes To Tower Over Al Pacino", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Al Pacino,Anna Paquin,Bobby Cannavale,Joe Pesci,Martin Scorsese,News,Ray Romano,Robert De Niro,Shoes", "news_keywords": "Al Pacino,Anna Paquin,Bobby Cannavale,Joe Pesci,Martin Scorsese,News,Ray Romano,Robert De Niro,Shoes", "description": "Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were photographed on the New York City set of their 2019 Martin Scorsese flick &mdash;
