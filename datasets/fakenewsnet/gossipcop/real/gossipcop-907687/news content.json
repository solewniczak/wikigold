The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate. But I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice because they didn\u2019t have a voice for so long. So I don\u2019t want to shut them down in any way.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fjames-franco8-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fjames-franco8-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fjames-franco8-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jodi Guglielmi", "Mia Mcniece", "January"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/sag-awards-2018-james-franco-attends/", "title": "James Franco Attends 2018 SAG Awards After Allegations of Sexually Inappropriate Behavior", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Awards Shows,James Franco,News,SAG Awards,Screen Actors Guild Awards", "news_keywords": "Awards Shows,James Franco,News,SAG Awards,Screen Actors Guild Awards", "description": "The event marked his first public appearance since five women accused James Franco of\u00a0sexually exploitative behavior\u00a0earlier this month", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "James Franco Attends 2018 SAG Awards After Allegations of Sexually Inappropriate Behavior", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/sag-awards-2018-james-franco-attends/", "description": "The event marked his first public appearance since five women accused James Franco of\u00a0sexually exploitative behavior\u00a0earlier this month", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fjames-franco8-1.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/movies/sag-awards-2018-james-franco-attends/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fjames-franco8-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/movies/sag-awards-2018-james-franco-attends/", "title": "James Franco Attends 2018 SAG Awards After Allegations of Sexually Inappropriate Behavior", "description": "The event marked his first public appearance since five women accused James Franco of\u00a0sexually exploitative behavior\u00a0earlier this month", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fjames-franco8-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/movies/sag-awards-2018-james-franco-attends/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
