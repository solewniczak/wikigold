I was between the ages of 4 and 8, somewhere in there,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI remember wishing her dead, and she ended up dying the next day in her graduation in a car accident.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI thought, \u2018Okay, now I\u2019ve killed her. I\u2019m magic. I can\u2019t tell my parents about this and I\u2019ve killed her,\u2019 so I started believing that I had this special power to kill people.\u201d\n\nAnderson recalled being terrified to tell her parents about her supposed ability, telling Morgan that she didn\u2019t tell them about the scary coincidence until \u201cyears later.\u201d\n\nAnderson revealed in 2014 that she was a victim of sexual abuse, saying she had been molested by her female babysitter in addition to being raped by an acquaintance.\n\n\u201cI went to a friend\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s house and his older brother decided to teach me backgammon, which led into a back massage, which led into rape,\u201d she said at the launch of The Pamela Anderson Foundation, an advocacy for animal rights. \u201cHe was 25 years old and I was 12.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Playboy model received backlash after suggesting Harvey Weinstein\u2019s accusers shouldn\u2019t have allowed themselves to be alone with him.\n\n\u201cWhen I came to Hollywood, of course I had a lot of offers to do private auditions and things that made absolutely no sense,\u201d she said during a November appearance on Megyn Kelly Today. \u201cJust common sense: don\u2019t go into a hotel room alone. If someone enters a door in a bathrobe, leave. These things that are common sense.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1477&h=739&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fpamela-anderson-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1477&h=739&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fpamela-anderson-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit", "March"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/pamela-anderson-special-powers-babysitter-molested-her-died/", "title": "Pamela Anderson Believed She Had a 'Special Power to Kill' After Her Molester Died Unexpectedly", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "News,Pamela Anderson,Sexual Assault", "news_keywords": "News,Pamela Anderson,Sexual Assault", "description": "Pamela Anderson\u00a0feared she had \"special powers\" after a babysitter she claimed molested her as a child was killed in a car accident just one day after the actress wished her dead", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Pamela Anderson Believed She Had a 'Special Power to Kill' After Her Molester Died Unexpectedly", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/pamela-anderson-special-powers-babysitter-molested-her-died/", "description": "Pamela Anderson\u00a0feared she had \"special powers\" after a babysitter she claimed molested her as a child was killed in a car accident just one day after the actress wished her dead", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1477&h=739&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fpamela-anderson-2000.jpg", "width": 1477, "height": 739}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/movies/pamela-anderson-special-powers-babysitter-molested-her-died/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fpamela-anderson-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/movies/pamela-anderson-special-powers-babysitter-molested-her-died/", "title": "Pamela Anderson Believed She Had a 'Special Power to Kill' After Her Molester Died Unexpectedly", "description": "Pamela Anderson\u00a0feared she had \"special powers\" after a babysitter she claimed molested her as a child was killed in a car accident just one day after the actress wished her dead", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1477&h=739&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fpamela-anderson-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/movies/pamela-anderson-special-powers-babysitter-molested-her-died/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/dv5hTeWTLUo"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
