Leave it to Britney to shake up international politics.\n\n\"We delayed the vote one day, to July 4. We couldn't hire enough security for the election because of the Britney Spears concert on July 3. There would also be a lot of traffic and roadblocks that would make it hard for the vote to go ahead,\" Labor Party spokesman Liron Zach said.\n\nSecurity and traffic concerns prompted move\n\nThe primary election will decide who becomes chairman of the party. The elected official will then enter the running to be prime minister.\n\nPhotos: Pop icon Britney Spears Photos: Pop icon Britney Spears Britney Spears arrives for a movie premiere in Hollywood in July 2019.
