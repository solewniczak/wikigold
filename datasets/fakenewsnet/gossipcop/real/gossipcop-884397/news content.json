We truly understand what these families are experiencing and hope to help in some way.\"\n\nGrimmie, who rose to fame on NBC's The Voice, died at age 22 in June 2016 after she was shot by Kevin James Loibl after her concert in Orlando, Fla. Her family established The Christina Grimmie Foundation after her death \"to provide financial, emotional and encouragement support to individuals and families who suffer from the devastating effects of gun violence.\"\n\n\"The Foundation is committed to helping impacted families experience the same type of love and support Christina Grimmie's family experienced from friends, family and the community at large when faced with the shock of losing their precious daughter to gun violence,\" according to the foundation's website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mass shooting that killed 49 at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., occurred days after Grimmie's death.
