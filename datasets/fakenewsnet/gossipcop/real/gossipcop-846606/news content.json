She opened up about her traumatic experience and trying to support other parents in similar situations to PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cThe holidays are a nightmare because I would have all of us together \u2014 friends, family, enemies alike,\u201d the star of HGTV and DIY Network\u2019s Rehab Addict tells PEOPLE, referring to her ex, Shane Maguire, with whom she shares child custody. \u201cThanksgiving was not my parenting time; therefore, I could not be with Harper.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nShe continues, \u201cEven on the worst day, my ex is encouraged and welcomed in our home. We recently all went trick-or-treating together, even thought it was \u2018my parenting time.\u2019 I always hope that the same courtesy will be extended, but it is not. I am not permitted to be with Harper during his time with his dad.\u201d\n\nMaguire\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nCurtis and Maguire recently reached a custody agreement after an ugly, years-long legal battle, but adhering to the court-mandated hand-offs and subsequently being separated from her toddler for extended periods has been a struggle for the home renovation star, especially at his time of year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been asked what my Thanksgiving plans are and receive horrified looks when I say, \u2018Nothing,'\u201d she wrote on Instagram on Thursday alongside a black-and-white photo of her, Harper, and her older son, Ethan, who she shares with ex Steven Cimini. \u201cOf course every bone in my body yearns to cook, entertain and stuff myself full of Gram\u2019s pie recipe that I never will get just right \u2014 but like so many others, we are trapped in the fd[sic] world of \u2018not your parenting time.'\u201d\n\nnicole-curtis-son Credit: Nicole Curtis/Instagram\n\nDespite her frustration with the arrangement, Curtis says she\u2019d welcome a blended family holiday \u2014 \u201cI would have my ex at my dining room table today, but\u2019s not up to me,\u201d she wrote \u2014 but she has a serious critique seemingly aimed at Maguire: \u201cIf you are the parent that refuses to allow your child the joy of having both parents in the same room (sans abusive/dangerous situation) \u2013 buck up \u2013 it\u2019s not about you,\u201d she writes, adding, \u201cGave someone that talk yesterday \u2013 got me nowhere, but no one ever said I wasn\u2019t persistent.\u201d\n\nF:PHOTOReady RoomActionsInsert Request47825#Nicole CurtisUnknown1.jpg Credit: From left: Nicole Curtis, her son Harper and Shane\n\nHarper coming down with a sudden illness right before Thanksgiving added to the stress of the situation, the mom of two tells PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cHe was sick the day before and I refused to transfer him when he was vomiting. His dad demanded that he be delivered as scheduled,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be called a negligent parent, but I will not be one.\u201d (In July, Maguire filed for sole custody of Harper, claiming Curtis was \u201cnot a fit\u201d mother, but later dropped the request.)\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t express in words what it feels like looking at your sick baby and being told that a \u2018parenting time\u2019 schedule trumps their wellbeing. I woke up Thanksgiving morning and thanked God that I was able to have that time with him,\u201d she continues. \u201cI arrived at the airport and literally had my baby ripped out of my arms and whisked away as I was \u2018screwing up\u2019 Thanksgiving plans. The cycle never ends.\u201d\n\nnicole-curtis-sons.jpg Curtis with her sons in 2019\n\nStill, Curtis sees one positive opportunity to come out of her situation: sharing her struggles with other parents, and telling them there\u2019s \u201cno shame\u201d in it.\n\n\u201cOver the past ten years [since Rehab Addict\u2019s debut], I have heard from hundreds of \u2018single\u2019 parents. They shared their stories and applauded seeing Ethan\u2019s dad and me in photos, from everything from soccer games to Christmas dinner,\u201d she tells PEOPLE referring her older son, now in his twenties. \u201cI encouraged each one to keep trying because it wasn\u2019t always that way and it took a lot of work.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of her Instagram post, she explains, \u201cI wrote my post because it\u2019s something that most people will luckily never understand, but those that do feel shame and just sadness. I am surrounded by AMAZING people and I still have to shake myself loose from the negativity and carry on and it\u2019s a struggle \u2014 I think of those parents that don\u2019t have that. And I have to think about them because they write me, sad and losing hope and the will to keep fighting for their children. Children deserve better.\u201d\n\nIn her 2016 memoir Better than New, Curtis describes Maguire\u2019s reaction to her pregnancy as unexpected and writes that she planned to move forward raising the child on her own. (Maguire\u2019s lawyer told PEOPLE in 2016 that his client \u201ccouldn\u2019t have been happier to find out he was the father to his son.\u201d)\n\nScreen Shot 2018-04-02 at 12.38.11 PM Credit: Nicole Curtis/Instagram\n\nMaguire filed for paternity and joint custody in December 2015. He was awarded both, according to The Detroit News.\n\nCurtis and Maguire\u2019s relationship had seemed to take a positive turn in March of 2018, when they had dinner together. \u201cShane has been to L.A. and the new house,\u201d Curtis told PEOPLE. \u201cWe went to dinner the other night just the two of us.\u201d But things quickly dissolved again when Curtis alleges, she was denied time with Harper on Easter.", "images":
