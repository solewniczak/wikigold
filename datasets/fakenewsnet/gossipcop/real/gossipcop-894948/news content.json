When the singer hit the American Music Awards red carpet on Sunday with her pal and stylist, Brad Goreski, by her side, she was greeted by Ramona \u2014 well, sort of.\n\nYou see Lea stopped to chat with E! News and it was then that they presented her with a video message filmed especially for her by The Real Housewives of New York City pal. The gift was enough to freak Lea out in the best way possible. But, you see, Ramona did want something in return \u2014 to have Lea sing \"Happy Birthday\" to her since she had just celebrated two days earlier. But that wasn't all. She also suggested that Lea hang with her and her Big Apple crew and perhaps make a cameo on RHONY at some point.\n\nIt was an offer that left Lea \"shaking\" all over. We mean, can you blame her?\n\nGood luck tonight @leamichele! \ud83d\udc9c Let\u2019s hang in NYC Xo @amas @enews @bradgoreski A post shared by Ramona Singer (@ramonasinger) on Nov 19, 2017 at 4:28pm PST\n\nUntil then, Lea might have to settle on weighing in on Housewives drama instead of participating in it.
