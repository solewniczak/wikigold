{"url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-and-bachelorette-couples-whos-still-together/", "text": "Kufrin broke tradition when she told PEOPLE she was engaged before the start of her big season - but was able to keep the (somewhat controversial) winner under wraps until the August 2018 finale.\n\n\"I feel like I could be happy with either guy and both of them would be a right choice for me,\" she said. \"But I'm going for the one that I can't see myself without. This love feels like it just fits my soul, it just fits my heart. I'm so happy that I pushed through to find what I've always wanted. I really feel like I've not only found my partner in this, but I've also found myself.\"\n\nIn June 2020, Kufrin revealed that she didn't \"know\" the status of her relationship with Yrigoyen following his support of law enforcement in the wake of national protests against systemic racism and police brutality.\n\nIn August 2020, after two years together, the pair called it quits. Kufrin confirmed the split on the podcast she cohosts with fellow Bachelorette alum, Rachel Lindsay, Bachelor Happy Hour.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to come as a shock to anyone, but Garrett and I have decided to end our engagement,\" Kufrin shared, acknowledging that fans have probably noticed on social media that they have been spending time apart.\n\nThe former Bachelorette said of the breakup, \"Garrett and I came to this decision after many conversations. It wasn't just something we just arrived at one night. It wasn't based solely off of one Instagram post or somebody else's opinions or comments. There's much more to it. To any relationship, there's a lot of layers. It's not for me to divulge details. It's no one's business other than what I'm telling you right now.\"\n\n\"We went on this crazy TV show over two years ago in hopes of finding love, and we were lucky enough that we did,\" Kufrin continued. \"We really, truly did. I'm so grateful for that opportunity and to have had the two-plus years with Garrett. Like I said, I still have so much love and compassion in my heart for him. Just because we've arrived at this decision now doesn't take away all of the years and the countless memories that we've made together. I will always look back at this time in my life with so much gratitude and love.\"", "images":
