Carlos), the wide-eyed baby boy who tags along with Zach Galifianakis, Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms in Las Vegas.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no mistaking him four years later in The Hangover Part III, in theaters Friday.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cThe cheeks kinda give it away, right?\u201d his mom, Carrie Holmquist, jokes to PEOPLE. In honor of the third installment (the last of the series, promises director Todd Phillips), we give you a trio of little known, fun facts about the littlest member of the franchise.\n\n1. HE WAS SURROUNDED BY THE LADIES IN VEGAS\n\nLittle ladies, that is. In the first movie, the role of Tyler/Carlos was primarily played by Grant, secondarily by his twin sister Avery, along with six other babies \u2013 all girls. After some early scheduling trouble, the Holmquist twins signed on for the film. \u201cWe started shooting in Vegas and it was the pool scene, which was fun,\u201d says Carrie. \u201cThey had shot for two days prior to us getting there, so there are a couple clips in that movie where it\u2019s not Grant or Avery.\u201d Otherwise, it\u2019s about \u201c60 percent Grant, 40 percent Avery,\u201d says their mom.\n\nFor the third installment, Grant won the role despite the initial call for 6-year-old child actors (he was 4-and-a-half when they filmed Part III) with an older understudy in place in case \u201che had a meltdown on set,\u201d jokes Carrie. (No spoilers here, but Grant\u2019s scene opposite Galifianakis in the latest installment is a scream.)\n\n2. HE LOVES ZACH GALIFIANAKIS\n\nCooper and Helms hung out with Grant between takes, but it was his scene partner, Galifianakis, who really stood out to the young actor. \u201cZach did an amazing job loosening Grant up,\u201d says his mom. \u201cHe\u2019s the type of kid who\u2019s very analytical and intelligent. So he kind of walks into a room and takes it all in first so it was really nice to have those personalities warm up to him.\u201d Today, \u201cWhen he sees him in the trailer or in the paper, he\u2019ll go, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s Zachy!\u2019 He\u2019s taken to calling him Zachy,\u201d says Carrie. \u201cGrant loves him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got to do a promotional photo shoot and that was an interesting day as well,\u201d says Carrie. \u201cWe were just lounging at the studio waiting for Grant\u2019s turn and there\u2019s Bradley on one couch and John Goodman walks by and Ken Jeong and I had a great heart to heart. He\u2019s a physician and has twins, too. Just nice, nice people.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=600&h=300&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2013%2F05%2Fgrant-holmquist-600.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2013%2F05%2Fgrant-holmquist-600.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=600&h=300&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2013%2F05%2Fgrant-holmquist-600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rennie Dyball", "Updated May"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/hangover-iii-baby-carlos-is-back-all-grown-up/", "title": "Hangover III: Baby Carlos Is Back, All Grown Up", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Bradley Cooper,John Goodman,The Hangover,Zach Galifianakis", "news_keywords": "Bradley Cooper,John Goodman,The Hangover,Zach Galifianakis", "description": "Grant Holmquist beat out a bunch of 6-year-old child actors to reprise his role in the new movie at just 4-and-a-half", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Hangover III: Baby Carlos Is Back, All Grown Up", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/hangover-iii-baby-carlos-is-back-all-grown-up/", "description": "Grant Holmquist beat out a bunch of 6-year-old child actors to reprise his role in the new movie at just 4-and-a-half", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=600&h=300&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2013%2F05%2Fgrant-holmquist-600.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 300}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/parents/hangover-iii-baby-carlos-is-back-all-grown-up/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2013%2F05%2Fgrant-holmquist-600.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/parents/hangover-iii-baby-carlos-is-back-all-grown-up/", "title": "Hangover III: Baby Carlos Is Back, All Grown Up", "description": "Grant Holmquist beat out a bunch of 6-year-old child actors to reprise his role in the new movie at just 4-and-a-half", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=600&h=300&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2013%2F05%2Fgrant-holmquist-600.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/parents/hangover-iii-baby-carlos-is-back-all-grown-up/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
