Representatives for the rapper have yet to respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nWest originally filed the lawsuit in August of 2017, about eight months after canceling the tour dates, claiming the insurance company had stalled on paying out the \u201cmulti-million dollar claim\u201d stemming from the canceled concerts.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by PEOPLE at the time, West\u2019s lawyers claimed that the insurers made their client go to great lengths to prove his mental breakdown was legitimate and that they were hunting \u201cfor some contrived excuse not to pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor have they provided anything approaching a coherent explanation about why they have not paid, or any indication if they will ever pay or even make a coverage decision, implying that Kanye\u2019s use of marijuana may provide them with a basis to deny the claim and retain the hundreds of thousands of dollars in insurance premiums,\u201d stated West\u2019s team in the filing.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kanye Was Unable to \u2018Snap Back\u2019 from Erratic Episodes Without Kim by His Side: Source\n\nLloyd\u2019s of London later hit back with a countersuit claiming they were not liable and had \u201cno duty\u201d to pay the sum.\n\nAccording to court documents filed in August of 2017 and obtained by PEOPLE at the time, syndicates of Lloyd\u2019s of London addressed several insurance policy exclusions relating to a preexisting physical or psychological condition, possession of illegal drugs, prescription drugs not taken as medically prescribed, and the consumption of alcohol rendering the insured unfit to \u201cperform contracted duties.\u201d", "images":
