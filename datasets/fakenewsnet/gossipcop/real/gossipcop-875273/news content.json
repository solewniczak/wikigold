There are flesh tones, which are hard enough to match as it is, and you have brighter hues (uh, meant to go where?), and then there are the rainbow of greens, pinks, and yellows. And now, you're lost. Don't worry\u2014at this point, most everyone is. It's way too easy to use the wrong shades for your skin tone and end up looking like an art class project. Celebrity makeup artist Nick Barose knows how you feel, and he's ready to help. \"Color correcting can be your best friend, but first you need to learn how to pick the right shades to address your concerns,\" says the pro. Steal his tips!\n\nChoose Your Colors Wisely\n\nGreen: \"This is great for canceling out really red areas, like when you have a pimple, rosacea, broken blood vessels, and even for people who get red rings around the eyes that can look very Twilight if not properly corrected.\"\n\nPro Pick: Maybelline Cover Stick Corrector Concealer in Green\n\nPink: \"This can even out fair skin that's ruddy, and will cancel out purple under eye circles on fair skin.\"\n\nPro Pick: Koh Gen Do Maifanshi Color Base in Lavender Pink\n\nYellow: \"This works on olive or tan skin and cancels out those purple-blue under eye circles and dark patches.\"\n\nPro Pick: Neutrogena Healthy Skin Smoothing Stick Treatment Concealer in Correcting Yellow\n\nNo need to play favorites.\n\nIf you need more than one hue to complete your look, spring for a palette. Barose raves about the ColoreScience Mineral Corrector Palette. \"You can use these to brighten under eyes, to correct redness on lids, or to blend shades together to perfectly hide discoloration. It's powder, so it mis with the warmth of your skin, leaving you with smooth, sheer coverage.\"\n\nFind the right formulation.\n\n\"When picking a corrector, color alone is not enough. The depth of the chosen shade is also key. For example, if you have darker skin, pick a deeper green. Pastels have too much white in them and will be too light for those skin tones.\"\n\nConceal as you would normally.\n\n\"Use these bright hues to correct the color and then cover it with your flesh-tone liquid foundation or sheer concealer. These are all meant to be worn under makeup. And always use sheer concealer when you're layering over a corrector because you don't want the end product to look too thick, especially around your eyes.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20150703034253im_/http://pixel.getchute.com/?dID=55142dfa7569c2712700000b&cID=1055&eTp=view_served", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150703034253im_/http://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/55829c6d941a95530d044bc6/master/pass/beauty-makeup-2013-08-color-correcting-th.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150703034253im_/http://www.teenvogue.com/images/author_default.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150703034253im_/http://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/55829c6d941a95530d044bc6/master/pass/beauty-makeup-2013-08-color-correcting-th.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eden Univer"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150703034253/http://www.teenvogue.com/story/color-correcting-concealer", "title": "A Cheat Sheet for Color Correcting Concealers", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "author": "Eden Univer", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2015", "keywords": "beauty products,concealer,concealer,beauty products", "og": {"site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "A Cheat Sheet for Color Correcting Concealers | Teen Vogue", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150703034253/http://www.teenvogue.com/story/color-correcting-concealer", "description": "Turn yourself into a mix master with these expert tips.", "type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150703034253im_/http://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/55829c6d941a95530d044bc6/master/pass/beauty-makeup-2013-08-color-correcting-th.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@teenvogue", "title": "A Cheat Sheet for Color Correcting Concealers | Teen Vogue", "description": "Turn yourself into a mix master with these expert tips.", "image": {"src": "http://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/55829c6d941a95530d044bc6/master/pass/beauty-makeup-2013-08-color-correcting-th.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "domain": "teenvogue.com"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
