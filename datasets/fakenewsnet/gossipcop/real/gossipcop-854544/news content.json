And they aren't the bodies of two strangers, but the decade-old corpses of Susan's parents. Series writer Ed Sinclair spent hours interviewing the real-life couple, who maintain their innocence, and other participants to create the darkly comedic, perspective-shifting series, while Sharpe (who previously collaborated with Colman in the Channel 4 series Flowers) takes a highly stylized approach to the visuals. Episodes will air weekly (and stream on HBO Max) on Mondays.\n\nMichael Bubl\u00e9's Christmas in the City Variety 10p\n\nOur Beloved Summer Foreign/Drama\n\nSecretly Santa Drama Lifeitme, 8p\n\nUnder the Vines Trailer Drama/Comedy Acorn TV\n\nA Very Boy Band Holiday Music 8p\n\n\u25a3 VOIR Trailer Documentary\n\nDavid Fincher is among the producers of this six-episode collection of \"visual essays\" about cinema.\n\nSUN / December 5\n\n23rd Annual A Home for the Holidays Special 9:30p ET / 9p PT\n\nA Furry Little Christmas Drama UP, 7p\n\nBeforeigners Trailer Foreign/Drama/Sci-fi HBO Max\n\nBruce Dickinson: Iron Maiden Frontman Reality/Music Reelz, 8p ET\n\nA Lot Like Christmas Drama GAC Family, 8p\n\nMr. A & Mr. M: The Story of A&M Records Trailer Documentary/Music Epix, 10p\n\nMy Favorite Christmas Melody Drama Lifeitme, 8p\n\nThe National Christmas Tree Lighting Special 8:30p ET / 8p PT\n\nReal Murders of Orange County Reality Oxygen, 7p\n\nSister Swap: A Hometown Holiday Drama Hallmark, 8p\n\nSmall Town Christmas Reality UP, 9p\n\nSomething's Coming: West Side Story Special 7p\n\nValley of the Queens Reality Science, 8p\n\nSAT / December 4\n\nChristmas Beneath the Stars Drama UP, 7p\n\nA Cl\u00fcsterf\u00fcnke Christmas Trailer Comedy 7p\n\nAna Gasteyer and Rachel Dratch write and star in a Comedy Central original holiday movie spoof about a city dweller who moves to an almost obscenely named but quaint small town to run an inn.

The adaptation of Judith C. Brown's nonfiction book Immodest Acts stars Virginie Efira, Charlotte Rampling, and Daphne Patakia.\n\nChasing Ghislaine Reality ID, 8p\n\nChristmas\u2026Again?!

But you are wrong. The recipient of excellent reviews out of TIFF in September, Penny Lane's highly entertaining documentary knows that that the smooth jazz saxophonist (who participates in the film) is hated by as many (or more) music fans than those who adore him and buy his records by the millions. And her painstakingly researched, often humorous film doesn't just trace his life story but focuses a good chunk of time on the backlash while exploring the meaning of \"good\" and \"bad\" music through interviews with music critics, DJs, and scholars.\n\n\u25a3 The Pact Drama Sundance Now\n\nPerfect Life (Vida Perfecta) Trailer Foreign/Drama/Comedy HBO Max\n\nQueen of the Universe Reality competition Paramount+\n\n\u25a3 Santa Inc Trailer Animation/Comedy HBO Max\n\nIt may be a stop-motion animated holiday series in the style of your favorite Rankin/Bass classics, but Santa Inc is definitely for adults, not kids.

The current Santa is voiced by Seth Rogen while other voices come from Maria Bamford, Nicholas Braun, Craig Robinson, Gabourey Sidibe, and Leslie Grossman.
