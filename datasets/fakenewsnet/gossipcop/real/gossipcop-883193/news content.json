And to have people say I\u2019m never going to have what she has or be what she is. I\u2019m not trying to be her. But I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t get hurt by this stuff,\u201d Sailor added. \u201cIt was just such a surreal moment for me because I\u2019ve looked up to all the SI models and my mom \u2014 they\u2019ve always been my inspirations.\u201d\n\nSee more of Christie and Sailor's stunning SI Swimsuit photos here:\n\n", "images":
