Not only did the young actor celebrate this latest Star Wars Day with Padme Amidala herself, Natalie Portman, but he also named his puppy Rey in honor of Daisy Ridley\u2019s character in the latest trilogy \u2014 and has met the real-life Ridley, as well.\n\nBut Wednesday night\u2019s The Book of Henry premiere saw him meet Mark Hamill, a.k.a. Luke Skywalker himself. Tremblay eagerly tweeted about the meeting \u2014 and shared pictures of the two of them on the red carpet \u2014 saying, \u201cGeeked out, big time, don\u2019t even care! Thank you [Mark Hamill] for chatting with me!\u201d He even added the hashtags, #Woah! and #LukeSkywalker.\n\nHamill, who\u2019s no stranger to surprising ardent Star Wars fans (like Adam Scott), retweeted Tremblay\u2019s tweet, adding, \u201cYou (& the entire cast) were wonderful in #TheBookOfHenry Jacob! A beautiful film \u2013 so unpredictable, heartfelt & moving #GreatMovie #JediJake\u201d\n\nHamill, Portman, and Ridley aren\u2019t the only Star Wars figures Tremblay has met since he shared his love for the franchise during 2016\u2019s awards season, where among other laurels he won a Critics\u2019 Choice Award for his role in Room and joked, \u201cI know where to put this: on the shelf, right beside my Millennium Falcon.\u201d\n\nHe also bumped elbows with The Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams at the AFI Awards, and had a mock lightsaber duel with actor Oscar Isaac, who plays Poe Dameron in the newest films. Tremblay has also penned some Star Wars fan fiction \u2014 as he tweeted earlier this month \u2014 joking, \u201cWho do I gotta talk to?\u201d\n\nThe Book of Henry arrives in theaters this Friday.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fgettyimages-696092322.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fgettyimages-696092322.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nivea Serrao", "June", "At Am Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/06/15/star-wars-jacob-tremblay-mark-hamill/", "title": "Star Wars superfan Jacob Tremblay meets Mark Hamill", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Jacob Tremblay,Mark Hamill", "news_keywords": "Jacob Tremblay,Mark Hamill", "description": "The 'Book of Henry' star met the Luke Skywalker actor at the premiere of his latest movie.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "'Star Wars' Superfan Jacob Tremblay Meets Mark Hamill", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/06/15/star-wars-jacob-tremblay-mark-hamill/", "description": "The 'Book of Henry' star met the Luke Skywalker actor at the premiere of his latest movie.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fgettyimages-696092322.jpg", "width": 1800, "height": 900}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/06/15/star-wars-jacob-tremblay-mark-hamill/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fgettyimages-696092322.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/06/15/star-wars-jacob-tremblay-mark-hamill/", "title": "'Star Wars' Superfan Jacob Tremblay Meets Mark Hamill", "description": "The 'Book of Henry' star met the Luke Skywalker actor at the premiere of his latest movie.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fgettyimages-696092322.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/06/15/star-wars-jacob-tremblay-mark-hamill/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497477600.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
