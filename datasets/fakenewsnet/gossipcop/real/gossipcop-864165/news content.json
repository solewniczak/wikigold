Injecting silicone destroys the underlying tissues by causing a severe inflammatory response and becomes a chronic problem.\u201d\n\nThey also warn against seeking any sort of surgery outside of the USA to save money, as doctors may not be as qualified and things can easily go wrong.\n\nWatch the clip below as Shauna outlines how she got to where she is today, starting off with how she began using black market hormone therapy when she was just 14.\n\nShe also recounts how in the black urban community, transgender people would rely on illegal silicone injections in their cheeks, breasts, and buttocks to get the feminized look they sought.\n\nShauna is seeking the doctors\u2019 help because she feels her right cheek has been left too big.\n\nSign up for our TV newsletter!\n\nBut the doctors caution her about the risks of doing more surgery and being left with an even bigger problem.\n\nDr. Dubrow says if things don\u2019t go quite right and nerves are damaged she could even lose all movement in her face\u2026\n\nBotched airs Sundays at 9pm PT/ET on E!", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e8ca1edafc65883dc9aba2d81553eb22?s=70&d=mm&r=g", "https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shauna-2.jpg?resize=773.5%2C434&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mc-logo-2022.png?fit=256%2C80&ssl=1", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FaKqbmR2K-sg%2F0.jpg", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/themes/generatepress_child/images/email.png", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/themes/generatepress_child/images/facebook.png", "https://i1.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shauna-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C574&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shauna.jpg?resize=773.5%2C433&ssl=1", "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/themes/generatepress_child/images/twitter.png"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shauna-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C574&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["April Neale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/tv/transgender-model-who-had-cheekbones-sawed-and-silicone-injections-seeks-help-on-botched/", "title": "Transgender model who had cheekbones \u2018sawed\u2019 and silicone injections seeks help on Botched", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "p": {"domain_verify": "9abcc0658f1dd4ad8d86a2c33eba0388"}, "google-site-verification": "W0V7_Td7mscUYxsJwzRBhIxHF4JB2PnzdGVKDImP54o", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Transgender model Shauna Brooks from Botched has had black market hormone therapy, silicone injections and \"sawed\" cheekbones, but it didn't all go to plan.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Transgender model who had cheekbones 'sawed' and silicone injections seeks help on Botched", "description": "Transgender model Shauna Brooks from Botched has had black market hormone therapy, silicone injections and \"sawed\" cheekbones, but it didn't all go to plan.", "url": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com/tv/transgender-model-who-had-cheekbones-sawed-and-silicone-injections-seeks-help-on-botched/", "site_name": "Monsters and Critics", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shauna-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C574&ssl=1", "width": 1024, "height": 574, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/monsterscritics", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/AprilMaryNeale/", "published_time": "2017-07-02T17:37:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-07-04T20:04:28+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/AprilMac", "site": "@monstersandcrit"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.9.2", "jetpack-boost-ready": "true", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cropped-MonstersAndCritics-flat-fix-pink-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499017049.0, "source": "https://www.monstersandcritics.com", "summary": ""}
