Within 10 seconds, she was like, 'Can I watch a real movie? Like, a good one?'\"\n\n\"We were like, 'What do you mean? This is a real movie! It was such a real movie they made, like, seven more of these!'\" he added. \"And, like, 10 more seconds went by and she was like, 'Please, can I watch a real movie?' And we were like, 'Fine, just put on Moana.'\"\n\nTatum and Dewan met on the set of Step Up, which opened in theaters in 2006. Dewan said in an interview with Late Night with Seth Meyers in May that Everly has followed in their footsteps by taking up dance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"[She didn't love it] at first,\" the actress confessed. \"She was like, 'I'm not taking a dance class.' I was like, okay, I'm not going to be a dance mom. I don't want to be the one that's like, 'No, you have to go,' all pushy.\"\n\n\"Then the first day, she goes, 'I want to go to dance class,'\" she recalled. \"I was like, 'Let's go!' I organized the troops. I was like, 'Get the tights, I need the shows, I want the bag, let's go!' She was into it.\"\n\nTatum and Dewan celebrated their eighth wedding anniversary in July. The actor will next star in Logan Lucky with Adam Driver, while Dewan serves as the host of the NBC reality competition World of Dance.", "images": ["https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/1811501692586/2017/1/82a47ab55b885a0815dec6bcf7138c82/v1.5/Channing-Tatum-says-daughter-Everly-doesnt-like-Step-Up.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/upi/1811501692586/2017/1/82a47ab55b885a0815dec6bcf7138c82/Channing-Tatum-says-daughter-Everly-doesnt-like-Step-Up.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/1811501692586/2017/1/82a47ab55b885a0815dec6bcf7138c82/v1.5/Channing-Tatum-says-daughter-Everly-doesnt-like-Step-Up.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Annie Martin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Movies/2017/08/02/Channing-Tatum-says-daughter-Everly-doesnt-like-Step-Up/1811501692586/", "title": "Channing Tatum says daughter Everly doesn't like 'Step Up'", "meta_data": {"description": "Channing Tatum said his 4-year-old asked for \"a real movie\" after he and Jenna Dewan attempted to show her \"Step Up.\"", "keywords": "Entertainment, Movies, Channing Tatum, Jenna Dewan, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Movies, Channing Tatum, Jenna Dewan, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Channing Tatum said his 4-year-old asked for \"a real movie\" after he and Jenna Dewan attempted to show her \"Step Up.\"", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Movies/2017/08/02/Channing-Tatum-says-daughter-Everly-doesnt-like-Step-Up/1811501692586/", "title": "Channing Tatum says daughter Everly doesn't like 'Step Up'", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/1811501692586/2017/1/82a47ab55b885a0815dec6bcf7138c82/v1.5/Channing-Tatum-says-daughter-Everly-doesnt-like-Step-Up.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 466}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPI", "title": "Channing Tatum says daughter Everly doesn't like 'Step Up'", "description": "Channing Tatum said his 4-year-old asked for \"a real movie\" after he and Jenna Dewan attempted to show her \"Step Up.\"", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1811501692586/2017/upi/82a47ab55b885a0815dec6bcf7138c82/v2.1/Channing-Tatum-says-daughter-Everly-doesnt-like-Step-Up.jpg?lg=4"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501624800.0, "source": "https://www.upi.com", "summary": ""}
