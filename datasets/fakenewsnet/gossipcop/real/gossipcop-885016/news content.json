However, Fey admits her daughter loves Parks and Rec but hates 30 Rock, and OUCH.\n\nFey is known for being a star and head writer at SNL, along with her many hilarious roles over the years, but perhaps her most iconic role is that of Liz Lemon on 30 Rock. In a recent appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers, the comedy legend says her 12-year-old daughter Alice simply isn\u2019t that into 30 Rock, and instead prefers Fey\u2019s longtime bestie Amy Poehler\u2019s show Parks and Recreation.\n\nFey revealed to her former SNL costar that Alice is getting into plenty of old classic comedies\u2026just not those starring mom. Ice cold.\n\nShe said that as her daughters get older, she\u2019s excited to show them all the movies she loves, sharing that Alice \u201cis getting a really great comedy education of her own.\u201d This summer she even binged watched all of The Office for the first time (ah, to be young and watching The Office).\n\nFey felt Alice was finally old enough to watch 30 Rock, but after a couple episodes, her daughter quipped: \u201cIt\u2019s too weird for me.\u201d\n\n\"I had to take that hit. That was a hard motherly hit to take,\" she said.\n\n\"She was like, 'What should I watch?' I was like, 'Well, you know, what about Parks and Recreation? You might really like that.' She goes, 'Oh, I watched all of it already.' It was so hard for me not to be like, 'GET IN YOUR ROOM AND WATCH 30 ROCK!' I wanted to spank her,\" she joked.\n\nFey said she \u201cfelt like that woman in Big Little Lies when she found out that Zo\u00eb Kravitz gave her kid birth control. I was like, \u2018You come to ME for that! You don\u2019t go to aunt Amy and Mike Schur!'\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F20%2Fsex-anxiety-tout.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F10%2F05%2FTina-Fey-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2016%2F08%2F25%2FDSC_0085-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F02%2F09%2FSwimsuits.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/misc/300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F17%2Fboob-sweat.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Fyuliya-kosolapova-bqirdOGHvYQ-unsplash-e1573767747444.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F07%2F08%2Fchiron-retrograde-2021.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F06%2F08%2Ffriendquestions-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fdream_about_ex.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F10%2F05%2FTina-Fey-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Arielle Tschinkel", "Updated Oct"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/tina-fey-daughter-loves-parks-rec-hates-30-rock/", "title": "Tina Fey says her daughter prefers \"Parks and Rec\" to \"30 Rock,\" and ouch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Amy Poehler,tina fey", "news_keywords": "Amy Poehler,tina fey", "description": "Tina Fey's daughter has great taste in comedies...but she thinks \"30 Rock\" is just too weird, and LOL.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Tina Fey says her daughter prefers \"Parks and Rec\" to \"30 Rock,\" and ouch", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/tina-fey-daughter-loves-parks-rec-hates-30-rock/", "description": "Tina Fey's daughter has great taste in comedies...but she thinks \"30 Rock\" is just too weird, and LOL.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F10%2F05%2FTina-Fey-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/tina-fey-daughter-loves-parks-rec-hates-30-rock/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F10%2F05%2FTina-Fey-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/tina-fey-daughter-loves-parks-rec-hates-30-rock/", "title": "Tina Fey says her daughter prefers \"Parks and Rec\" to \"30 Rock,\" and ouch", "description": "Tina Fey's daughter has great taste in comedies...but she thinks \"30 Rock\" is just too weird, and LOL.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F10%2F05%2FTina-Fey-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/tina-fey-daughter-loves-parks-rec-hates-30-rock/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Sjd4BVHdc8"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
