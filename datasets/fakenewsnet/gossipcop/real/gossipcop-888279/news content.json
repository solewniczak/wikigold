We\u2019re just very different, we\u2019re very different. And we were very young and new.\u201d\n\n'The Emoji Movie' film premiere, Arrivals, Los Angeles, USA - 23 Jul 2017\n\n\u201cYou have to learn \u2014 women have to learn how to support each other,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not taught to each other in the playground.\u201d\n\nWhen Cohen asked if Pink had attempted to make an argument into a physical fight, the pop star revealed, \u201cActually, she swung at me in a club.

I feel so good about that.\u201d\n\nWhile she may have made up with Aguilera, the singer is not backing down from comments made against Kim Kardashian West when the reality star posed a nude bathroom selfie last year.\n\nPink shared a message on Twitter that seemingly took aim at Kardashian West for using her sexuality to get attention instead of her \u201cbrains,\u201d \u201cstrength,\u201d or \u201cwork ethic.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Why Pink Regrets Saying She\u2019s Team Taylor Swift\n\n\u201cHonestly, she went in on Bette Midler,\u201d Pink said, referring to Kardashians tweet slamming
