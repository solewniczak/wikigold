He was also lifting props without a problem.\n\nTMZ broke the story ... George slammed into a car going 60 mph in Sardinia. He went flying, nearly 20 ft into the air, before slamming down to the ground. Still, he walked away from the accident with bruises and zero broken bones.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/fd/16by9/2022/03/15/fd42a92af0794dba86e56ccddd3d992a_xs.jpg",
