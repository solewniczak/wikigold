First designed by Lindy Hemming, second by Michael Wilkinson. Some steps backwards, me thinks,\u201d a fan tweeted (below).\n\nNot long after the discovery, fans created an uproar on social media, noting that the costumes in Justice League (designed by a man, in a film directed by a man) sexualized the female actors, while in Wonder Woman (directed by a woman, with costumes designed by a woman) did not appear overtly sexual.\n\nLooking for more style content?

Then, in Justice League, Ence sports a bra top revealing her abs, along with brief-like shorts that show much more of her legs than in the previous movie.\n\n\u201cBrooke Ence plays the Amazon warrior Penthesilea in Wonder Woman (left) and Justice League (right). First designed by Lindy Hemming, directed by Patty Jenkins Second designed by Michael Wilkinson, directed by Zack Snyder. People are pretending there\u2019s no difference,\u201d the Twitter user said.\n\nHowever, another fan of the films pointed out that there were, in fact, some sexier costumes worn in Wonder Woman too. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not a fan of skimpy Amazon costumes, but if you\u2019re going to share the Justice League pic, remember these were their training costumes in Wonder Woman,\u201d she said.\n\nUPDATE 11/15: AJustice League actress and stuntwoman who wore the skimpy Amazon costumes in the film spoke out about the controversy on Twitter and defended director Zack Snyder\u2019s decision to dress the warriors in a more revealing look.\n\nSamantha Jo, the actress who played Amazon warrior Euboea in the DC Comics films (and worked with Snyder on many of this productions in the past), said: \u201cI think that the Amazons (being a race that lives with only other women) should be free to wear as much or as little clothing as each individual wants. And this was reflected in the variations of the armor that was tailored to each individual. I think that the sexualization happens largely in the intent of the creators. In this case. I\u2019ve heard Zack Snyder and Michael Wilkinson\u2019s name being thrown about.\u201d\n\nJo continued by explaining her experiences with Snyder and costume designer Wilkinson have been nothing but positive. \u201cI have NEVER felt more empowered than I have on Zack Snyder sets. I have never once been told to sand in a pretty way or perform something with more skin or feminine movements. I have been most appreciated for my strong stances and posture in my fighting. I\u2019ve always felt not just comfortable, but confident in what I was wearing and how I was being represented,\u201d she said.\n\nShe then addressed the issue that in Wonder Woman, the Amazon warrior costumes did not appear nearly as sexualized as they did in Justice League, which according to Jo \u201ccame with a cost.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, the Wonder Woman costumes might have covered some women up a little more, but at least with my experience\u2026 there was chafing, scrapes, pinched and bruised skin at my shoulder/arm joint, stepping on my leather straps and tripping,\u201d she said. \u201cFor practical reasons, I personally was very happy when Michael offered up solutions for my Justice League costume that made me the most comfortable in my work and in my body.\u201d", "images":
