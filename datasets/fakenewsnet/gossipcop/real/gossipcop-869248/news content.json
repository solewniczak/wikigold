His wife, Linda, was driving and was injured when the crash happened at an intersection in Palm Beach Gardens.\n\nCourt filings from last week show that the case was dismissed with prejudice after a settlement was reached between Williams and Barson's estate, but the settlement amount was not listed.\n\nNo charges were filed against the tennis star and a second driver over the crash in June 2017, Florida authorities said.\n\nAn investigation supported by video surveillance showed Williams did not violate the other driver's right of way, the Palm Beach Gardens Police said in an investigative report obtained by CNN affiliate WPBF.\n\nRead More", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170703165649-venus-williams-tease-1-super-tease.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220310132215-putin-meeting-0310-large-169.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170629204411-venus-williams-0629-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220314043827-david-sanger-ukraine-map-new-day-03142022-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220314162419-protester-large-169.jpeg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220315150612-drone-explosion-ukraine-vpx-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170629204411-venus-williams-0629-exlarge-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220315170926-ukraine-mariupol-pregnant-woman-large-169.jpeg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220314100717-marie-yovanovitch-trump-split-for-video-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220313183740-tom-brady-returns-2022-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220313103907-kyiv-mayor-brother-large-169.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220315120840-zelensky-canada-remarks-large-169.jpeg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220313133214-egils-levits-0313-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220313125509-yevgenia-albats-russian-journalist-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220313111357-brent-renaud-file-2015-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220314104426-04-five-things-ukraine-03-14-intl-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220313180326-training-ground-near-lviv-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220315184313-gop-ad-thumbnail-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220312121259-alleged-syrian-fighters-large-169.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170703165649-venus-williams-tease-1-super-tease.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Faith Karimi", "Madeline Holcombe"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/21/us/venus-williams-fatal-accident-no-charges/index.html", "title": "Venus Williams reaches settlement in wrongful death lawsuit over fatal car crash", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "section": "us", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"pubdate": "2018-11-21T06:54:01Z", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/21/us/venus-williams-fatal-accident-no-charges/index.html", "title": "Venus Williams reaches settlement in wrongful death lawsuit over fatal car crash", "description": "Two weeks after the accident, a passenger in one of the vehicles died.
