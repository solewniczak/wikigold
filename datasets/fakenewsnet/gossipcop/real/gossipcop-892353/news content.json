As a matter of fact. I hadn\u2019t actually seen him in, like, four years. It was kind of an awesome rumor. I kind of liked it. I was like, \u2018OK, fine. We\u2019re having twins!'\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Sealed With a Kiss!

The Rules of Engagement actor took to Instagram to jokingly unleash a massive list of fake grievances he has against Pitt alongside a picture of a tabloid cover of the two.\n\n\u201cHe drinks out of the f\u2014 carton and he leaves the door open when he\u2019s taking a dump!!\u201d the 40-year-old actor jokingly vented on Instagram. \u201cAnd this is when he\u2019s at MY house!!! He\u2019s already calling me brother and has driven a wedge between myself and my real brother Wyatt who now won\u2019t speak to me.\u201d\n\nOliver went on to write even their mom Goldie Hawn, was \u201covertly flirting with him,\u201d going around \u201cwearing these little nighties around the house.\u201d\n\nHudson was one of the actresses Pitt was linked to after splitting from Angelina Jolie in September 2016.
