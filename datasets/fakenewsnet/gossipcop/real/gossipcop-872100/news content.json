My Next Guest Needs No Introduction will be a six-episode limited series which, unlike most shows within the Netflix purview, will be released one at a time, monthly, rather than all at once. Here's a teaser.\n\nLetterman's been off TV since his widely-publicized retirement in May 2015, which was overshadowed by his even-more-publicized retirement beard. Yeah, it's only been two and a half years.
