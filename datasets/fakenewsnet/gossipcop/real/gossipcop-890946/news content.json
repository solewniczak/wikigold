I love putting things on social media, so it was all over social media,\u201d Chrisley, 20, told E!\u2019s Daily Pop on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s my fault at that point, but I\u2019m great today.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nAfter four months of dating, the Chrisley Knows Best star and newly-drafted NBA player \u2014 who made their romance Instagram official in June when Kennard, 21, was selected by the Detroit Pistons as the 12th pick of the 2017 NBA draft \u2014 broke up in August. Prior to Kennard, she was formerly linked to Memphis Grizzlies player Chandler Parsons and split from longtime boyfriend Blaire Hanks in January after a two-year romance.\n\nAlthough Chrisley and Kennard weren\u2019t meant to be, the reality star learned a great deal about herself through their relationship.\n\n\u201cI mean, you live and you learn. I\u2019ve learned a lot of things that I don\u2019t want and that\u2019s what relationships are for. You date people to figure out what you want and don\u2019t want,\u201d she said, and added, \u201cand thankfully, I dodged a bullet on the last one.\u201d\n\nIn a previous statement to E! News, Chrisley revealed the reasoning for her split from Kennard. \u201cThe last 4 months I\u2019ve been dating Luke have been great but as a young woman of faith I made the decision that with where Luke and I both are in our careers, it was best to part as friends rather than deal with the pressures of wondering if you are the only one. I was brought up to know my worth. I\u2019m 20 now and so excited to live my life as beautifully as God intended,\u201d she shared. \u201cI will forever love the Kennard family.\u201d\n\nNicole Miller - Front Row & Backstage - September 2016 New York Fashion Week: The Shows Credit: Desiree Navarro/WireImage\n\nAs for what Chrisley\u2019s father, Todd, thinks of his daughter\u2019s decision to share details about the split on social media, he told Daily Pop, \u201cI don\u2019t think that you should ever put all your business on the front porch for everybody to see. And I think that because of who she is, everything that she does and everything that any of our family members do, it\u2019s out there for the public to see.\u201d\n\nStill, Todd isn\u2019t too concerned about the public\u2019s opinion of himself or his family.\n\n\u201cAre celebrities judged differently? Absolutely we\u2019re judged differently \u2014 but we\u2019re also paid differently,\u201d he shared. \u201cSo you know, put up with the bull\u2014-, cash your check and keep it moving because at the end of the day, what someone\u2019s opinion of me sitting in their kitchen in their underwear is not something I\u2019m concerned about.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F06%2Fsavannah-chrisley-1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fsavannah-chrisley-luke-kennards-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fsavannah-chrisley-luke-kennards-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone", "November"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/savannah-chrisley-talks-split-luke-kennard-dodged-bullet/", "title": "Savannah Chrisley on Split from Luke Kennard: 'I Dodged a Bullet'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Breakups,News,Savannah Chrisley,Todd Chrisley", "news_keywords": "Breakups,News,Savannah Chrisley,Todd Chrisley", "description": "Chrisley and Kennard split in August after four months of dating", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Savannah Chrisley on Split from Luke Kennard: 'I Dodged a Bullet'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/savannah-chrisley-talks-split-luke-kennard-dodged-bullet/", "description": "Chrisley and Kennard split in August after four months of dating", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fsavannah-chrisley-luke-kennards-1.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/savannah-chrisley-talks-split-luke-kennard-dodged-bullet/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fsavannah-chrisley-luke-kennards-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/savannah-chrisley-talks-split-luke-kennard-dodged-bullet/", "title": "Savannah Chrisley on Split from Luke Kennard: 'I Dodged a Bullet'", "description": "Chrisley and Kennard split in August after four months of dating", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fsavannah-chrisley-luke-kennards-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/savannah-chrisley-talks-split-luke-kennard-dodged-bullet/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
