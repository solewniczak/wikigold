At one point, the topic turns to whether Amy Schumer is adopting her husband\u2019s last name.\n\n\u201cAre you still Amy Schumer or are you Amy Fischer now?\u201d Gordon Schumer asks, according to a transcription in multiple outlets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not Amy Fischer!\u201d his daughter replies, laughing. \u201cDo you remember who Amy Fisher is? The Long Island Lolita,\u201d referring to the infamous Merrick native with a slightly different last name who, as a 17-year-old on May 19, 1992, shot Mary Jo Buttafuoco, then wife of her 38-year-old lover, Massapequa auto mechanic Joey Buttafuoco.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m keeping my last name,\u201d Amy Schumer assured her father. \u201cI\u2019m keeping your last name.\u201d\n\nFisher, whom the press dubbed the Long Island Lolita, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and served 7 years at the Albion Correctional Facility in New York. She had been a senior at John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore at the time of the shooting. Schumer graduated in 1999 from South Side High School in Rockville Centre.\n\nSchumer, who ranked No. 5 on Forbes magazine\u2019s 2017 list of highest-earning comedians, has not commented further on social media. Her most recent post, on her regular Instagram account Tuesday, was a joking \u201cHappy birthday to my real husband @Common,\u201d the rapper-actor, who turned 46 that day.\n\nFischer, whom Schumer married in a small, unannounced ceremony last month in Malibu, California, became known in culinary circles as sous chef at Mario Batali\u2019s restaurant Babbo in Manhattan, and went on to win a 2016 James Beard Award for \u201cBeetlebung Farm Cookbook: A Year of Cooking on Martha\u2019s Vineyard.\u201d He and \u201cTrainwreck\u201d and \u201cSnatched\u201d star Schumer, whose new comedy \u201cI Feel Pretty\u201d is due out April 20, have been on an extended honeymoon, most recently in Milan and Venice.", "images":
