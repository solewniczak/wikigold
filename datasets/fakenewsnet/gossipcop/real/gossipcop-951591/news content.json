They only started working together a few months ago. He was reluctant to sign her at first because of The Housewives, but her work ethic surprised him in many ways and sealed the deal. They\u2019ve been a great team since,\u201d a second source tells PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cTheir chemistry was instant. He\u2019s very aggressive and she goes toe-to-toe with him.

The couple announced their split in August 2017.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cWe care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!\u201d\n\nDe Lesseps later told PEOPLE that \u201cthis has been one of the toughest times of my life.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Luann de Lesseps Says Her Arrest Cost Her Friends and Boyfriends\n\nA year after tying the knot with D\u2019Agostino, de Lesseps was arrested on Christmas Eve 2017 in Palm Beach, Florida, and charged with disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant.
