The series was created by Todd J. Greenwald, and stars Selena Gomez, David Henrie and Jake T. Austin as three wizard siblings with magical abilities competing to win sole ...read more. Oh I love this show. When I was younger, I wasn't allowed to watch this show because of its magic, but now that I'm older, I've watched almost all of the seasons. Now THIS actually has humor that I LAUGH at. It's funny, and charming. The whole atmosphere of each interesting character who don't annoy me in the slightest (okay maybe a little but that's nothing compared to most of Disney Channel's other shows).\n\n\n\nWhat I love most is Selena Gomez's acting here. She portrayed Alex Russo perfectly. The sarcasm, the moments she has with her friends and family, just - ugh, I loved it and still do as someone in high school going into college. What I also love about this show is the fact that each character grows and changes as time goes on. They actually learn from some of their mistakes and grow as a person. And they entertain me with their actually funny jokes on the way.\n\n\n\nI give this show an 8/10. Worth watching guys, even though it doesn't have that much of a plot. But I still ...more I will really miss. Especially alex russo played by Selena Gomez. I will miss the whole atmosphere of waiting for a new episode. I shall cry on the last episode. I wish I was BFF with Selena because she is a great actor and singer but I prefer her as an actor.\n\n\n\nI hope the have another movie...\n\n\n\nLove you WOWP\n\n\n\nYou were the best show ever\n\n\n\nReally miss can't believe it is over.. I can still remember watching the first episode and being gripped and not being able to say Waverley properly when I told my friends about the amazing show I give Wizards of Waverly Place a B+. Its settings and magic make this feel like pure Disney. I do wish Even Stevens, The Famous Jett Jackson, Toon Disney cartoons (especially Gargoyles, Fillmore!, Lilo & Stitch: The Series and Darkwing Duck), Kim Possible and et cetera et cetera were extremely high on this list.\n\n\n\nI give The Suite Life of Zack & Cody franchise a C+. Sorry, but the characters are stereotypical. But the 2000s reminds me of my top-favorite looking destinations enough to recommend this.\n\n\n\nI give Good Luck Charlie a B-. Yes, it got more one-dimensional in the future like in Wizards of Waverly Place. But it was very realistic and finds ways to get its not-too-young demographic to relate to this show.\n\n\n\nI give That's So Raven an A+. That's So Raven/Epic has very three-dimensional characters. Its GBA games have extremely motivational music (after all, it is That's So Raven), even for GBA standards.\n\n\n\nI give Jessie an F. It is racist, stereotypical and ...more I LOVE the show wizards of waverly place more than everything in the world! To this day, I watch it every single day. I am literally watching it right now. I love all of the characters, every episode and Max is hilarious! I would LOVE for wizards of waverly place to have another show like how \"That's so Raven\" or \"Full House\" did. I am obsessed with this show in every way possible. My favorite episode is the last episode because Max's lines were so funny...I was cracking up for weeks such as when he said \"Alex of course I forgive you...any sister of Justin's is a sister of mine\". Or when he said to Rootie tootietootie \"What do I know you from? \" or when...well you get the point. I love, love, love this show and I'm happy that it's number 1 because Wizards of Waverly Place definitely deserves #1! Yay!\n\nThe Suite Life of Zack and Cody The Suite Life of Zack & Cody is an American sitcom created by Danny Kallis and Jim Geoghan. The series was first broadcast on Disney Channel on March 18, 2005, with 4 million viewers, making it the most successful premiere for Disney Channel in 2005. It was one of their first five shows available on ...read more. A really fun show, great for kids 7 and up in my opinion. I personally think that this show is better than Wizards of Waverly Place as the plot didn't get continous and I was really sad when I finished watching it. There us a spin off show that wasn't as good, but I still enjoyed it. And that review is coming from a teenager! So never say you're too old for Disney Channel! This show was one of my favorites when I was a kid! I recently watched a few episodes late at night (yes, it does air on Disney Channel now but at night haha! ) and I still laugh at their jokes to this day.\n\n\n\nWhat makes this show great is the fact that even though the characters can be stereotypical and all (like, London can be very annoying, but that was until I watched the recent shows on Disney Channel), they have their redeeming qualities that are highlighted well. Even though London, for example, is the typical rich, greedy child who complains all the time and gets what she wants, we are reminded later in the show several times why she is like that, and that she can be kind at times and not ALWAYS who she comes off as. Plus, Zack and Cody are so charming and their lives are so interesting and always adventurous. The suite life of Zack and Cody is in my opinion the best show to ever air on Disney. The characters themselves are creative, funny and unique in their own way and make you laugh till your ribs hurt. The actors/actresses are some of the best to ever come out of Disney and are all successful. The storylines are great and original and teach young children great life lessons about friendship, family and relationships. The show also teaches children that they will get in trouble if they do something bad. I miss Zack and Cody so much and I wish old Disney would come back. Good luck in college. Zack and Cody was my life! I miss it so much! I do love Wizards of Waverly place but Zack and Cody should be #1. It was the longest Disney Channel show ever and also has the most episodes. I miss it watching Zack and Cody running around the hotel and seeing London and Maddie have a competition or fight and then make-up. I even miss Mr. Moseby! I was so happy to see him return on Jessie! (Debby's show that now ended) I also was happy how every door had the Tipton hotel logo. And also when Mr. Moseby calls Cody! My point is Zack and Cody was the best childhood T.V. show!\n\nGood Luck Charlie Good Luck Charlie is an American sitcom that originally aired on Disney Channel from April 4, 2010, to February 16, 2014. The series' creators, Phil Baker and Drew Vaupen, wanted to create a program that would appeal to entire families, not just children. This was another one of the only 3-4 good sitcoms on Disney Channel. It actually focuses on a little thing called REALITY, like being a Teenager and living in a middle class big family. But the family, unlike most where they are just completely flawless, with flawless kids and flawless everything, they actually have problems with their finances, and family troubles. They don't focus on small thing like, not being able to sing for a few days, or not liking a girl just because her breath is bad. (examples come from Austin and Ally) They actually show what it's like to be cheated on by a boy, or having a crush that you just can't get over but you are too shy to tell them, or puberty, and overall it focuses on a happy but not flawless family. This show focuses on two very good things, and that is to be a good example for your younger siblings and that overall family is an amazing thing. I think Good Luck Charlie is the last great show on Disney Channel. It has a plot, while keeping the storyline simple and funny, the characters are hilarious and sweet, and I think it's very relatable and leaves good overall messages to kids.\n\n\n\nFirst off, the storyline. Basically, the protagonist, Teddy, records moments in her life into a collection of videos to Charlie, the second-youngest child of the family. Teddy shows the family's relatable conflicts, her own personal problems, her secrets, what happens around as each day passes, and such and such. She gives advice to Charlie for her future self, and I think that's sweet. The whole family is sweet and funny, and they all grow up (especially Gabe to me). Good Luck Charlie is definitely a great show and is enjoyable for a wide range of ages! Good plot lines, good actors, HOWEVER they take so much material from Full House that they might as well call it \"Good Luck Michelle\" (Michelle is the baby/ little girl in Full House)\n\n\n\nSimilarities:\n\n1. In Good Luck Charlie the dad says \"I'm not an exterminator, I'm a pest control specialist.\" Yeah, Jesse said that on Full House.\n\n2. Michelle and Charlie- toddlers who occasionally talk.\n\n3. The similarities between the names D.J. (oldest daughter in Full House) and P.J.\n\n4. Stephanie, the middle daughter on Full House, is sarcastic, as is Gabe, who is also the middle child.\n\n5. On Full House, Jesse is somewhat dim-witted, likes girls, and has a band. So does PJ.\n\nI can name a ton of other similarities, but I think 5 points is enough. However, a lot of kids do not watch Full House these days (mostly teens and adults do), so I guess this all slips under the radar. And, honestly, I love Good Luck Charlie, even despite the extreme similarities to Full House. It's by far ...more This should be below Jessie, for a bunch of reasons: Bridgit Mendler, as an actress, needs to work on her facial expressions a lot (tries too hard to make happy faces), the plot is so cheesy and weird, Charlie is more of a prop for the show, and a lot of moments that gross me out, such as the scene where Gabe is covered in baby food in the dentist episode. Really Disney? It is also worth noting that the show tends to recycle characters, and is just way too predictable. Meanwhile, on Jessie, the kids can act, I was actually convinced that Karan Brar was Indian for a while there, and it actually has a plot, I also stomach Jessie more than any other Disney show other than Girl Meets World. How this show is so popular with voters? I will never know, but I do know that it's really not so good. Watch Jessie instead! There, hope I helped!\n\nGravity Falls Gravity Falls is an American animated television series produced by Disney Television Animation that first aired on Disney Channel, and then on Disney XD from June 15, 2012 to February 15, 2016. The series follows the adventures of Dipper Pines and his twin sister Mabel in the fictional town of Gravity ...read more. Best Show not just in Disney, but in Television in General. You have many likable characters like Dipper, Mabel, and Stan just to name a few plus an excellent performance by their voice actors (Jason Ritter, Kristen Schall, Alex Hirsch himself). A complex plot full of great writing and mystery (you can't really tell what will happen next) and one that has coherent and cohesion woven together. Let's not forget the humor, scary moments, and the complex character relationship between the Pines. No wonder this is so appealing to many people even years after it's over. Want to get hooked? Check the first episode. This show is a masterpiece. The plot was made with wonderful twists, turns, and surprises. There's an eerie, yet fun vibe to it that keeps you entertained. It has an incredible, emotional, and satisfying end and didn't fall into the 'too many seasons' hole that so many Disney shows fall into. The characters are great most of the times. The jokes and humor can get surprisingly adult for a kids show. If you haven't seen this show, and you're thinking of giving it a try give the first five episodes a watch before deciding to continue, because, trust me, you will be hooked by then. This show is one of the best Disney Channel shows I've seen in years. I personally think even Phineas and Ferb can't beat it.\n\n\n\nThe best part is the cast of characters. Dipper is logical, Mabel is eccentric, Grunkle Stan (short for Great Uncle Stan) is a scam-artist but still warm-hearted, Soos is the strange but funny maintenance guy at Stan's Mystery Shack, and Wendy is the chill and awesome teenage girl who works at the Mystery Shack, too.\n\n\n\nThis show provides many funny moments for people of all ages, whether it be the fact that Mabel is eating hallucinogenic candy or there are gnomes barfing rainbows on your screen. \"Gravity Falls\" deserves so much better! This is probably one of the smartest cartoons out there and gives Disney Channel a bit of a darker edge, thereby appealing to older kids. The characters are really good, the voice acting is excellent, and one of the villains, Gideon Gleeful, has to be one of the best characters on that show next to Mabel. He's edgy, original, and adorable. You think that most villains would be ugly, but Gideon uses his looks to get his way, being only nine.\n\n\n\nPlus his plots to get what he wants are pretty original. He doesn't kill to get what he wants. He steals, manipulates, and even uses love. The only downfall is that he hasn't used hypnosis. But \"Gravity Falls\" is definitely one of the best shows on Disney today!\n\nThat's So Raven That's So Raven is an American supernatural teen sitcom television series. It debuted on the Disney Channel on January 17, 2003, and ended its run on November 10, 2007. The show had a spin-off series, Cory in the House. The series was nominated in 2005 and 2007 for Emmy Awards for Outstanding Children's ...read more. By far the best show that Disney has ever made. The stories of each episode were well thought out and constructed perfectly. Raven totally encapsulates me as a person and I'm sure countless others. I really love how this show displayed integrity but at the same time depict such hilarious situations in which was much appreciated. This show definitely put me on the verge of crying my eyes out due to the sensational comedy acting given off by the actors especially raven. There will definitely not be a show like this in Disney again, That's so raven was one of kind and I'm glad and grateful to have come across such a show. I'm literally in awe of this show. The talents the actors possess is remarkable and needs to be commanded. Best show ever!\n\nThis show had such good morals. For example, the episode where they put Raven's head on another body in a magazine because she wasn't skinny enough showed people that being a size 2 is okay. Just by the way Raven told the editor of the magazine off was amazing because she showed her that there is beauty in all sizes. Not to mention this plot was so relatable! We all get insecure because of our size but we then somehow get the strength like Raven did in this episode.\n\nAlso, other plots in the show were very relatable. Like the plot where Sydney was doing drugs or the plot where they all had junk food for lunch. Guaranteed, some plots were outrages. But the moral was still there.\n\nThis show didn't have to come up with a new song every week because it didn't need too. The writing and acting was amazing and could carry the show from start to finish.\n\nThis was one of the best Disney shows that Disney came up. That's So Raven was probably my favourite Disney Channel show growing up. It had humour, heart, drama, and all that other good stuff. The characters were real and the acting didn't feel fake or forced. The show taught kids important things, like the dangers of smoking, racism, body image, healthy eating, shoplifting, and family values. Now on kid's shows the characters are whiny, self-centered, and and vane.\n\n\n\nWatching old episodes of That's So Raven today I still laugh my ass off! It had \"wacky\" situations without being tacky or annoying, unlike most kid's shows these days. That's So Raven was and still is loved by both kids and adults to this day. I love That's so Raven! Out of all of the old Disney channel shows, this is the best. It has a lot of humor and heart, and that's something I really like about the show. The show also can teach you important life lessons like in episode nine, there is this mean girl who on purpose throws her party on the same day as Raven's party so no one will go to her party. Raven has the chance to get revenge on her but if she did it would make her look just as bad as the mean girl does. The lesson is just because someone is mean to you, don't be mean to them. Anyways, even though the show got canceled after long years, we will always remember it and the show will go down in entertainment history!\n\nKim Possible Kim Possible is an American animated children's television series created by Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle for Disney Channel. Kim Possible needs to be up in the top 10! It aired for so dang long and was such a FANTASTIC SHOW! I'm completely SHOCKED to see that people love Good luck Charlie and Jessie so much... THOSE SHOWS aren't EVEN GOOD... Good Luck Charlie is pretty close to Life With Derek except they try to make it funny by making nothing serious and it's just awful... Same with Jessie except Jessie is a billion times worse... I can't even stand watching Jessie... *sigh* I guess people love Jessie so much because their aren't many good shows to compare it to... In fact, there are currently no good Disney Shows AT ALL (besides Gravity Falls) Warning: This show contains well developed characters, original story lines, tons of humor, and awesome animation. Not meant for those who live a boring lifestyle void of fun and enjoyment. Do not allow children to watch due to the danger that they might get hooked on this great show. Do not allow them to watch due to the danger that they might attempt to imitate Kim's butt-kicking talents which include olympic level gymnastics and tumbling skills, knowing 16 styles of kung fu, skydiving, cliff climbing, grappling, dodging energy comet-powered plasma blasts, escape unharmed through A...\n\n\n\nOkay, now that that's over, in case there was any confusion, everything above were all huge complements. Great show, great chracters, great animation, well you get the point. Kim does show her midriff most of the time through seasons 1-3, but other than that, awesomest, most badical show ever on Disney. This list is stupid. Kim Possible is the best series in the world.\n\n\n\nDr. Drakken and Ron are my joint favorite characters in the series.\n\nAre both so funny and awesome. And of course, the main character Kim Possible...\n\nKim Possible is the hottest women in the world. She is amazingly beautiful and sexy beauty. Her eyes, hairs and haircuts is so hot and unique. Sometimes she is funny, sometimes she is so charismatic. Kim is my role model.\n\n\n\nBest show of all time. Kim Possible is definitely deserve to be number 1. Rock on Dr. Drakken and Ron! I love everything the show stands for, right to the end. For a brief moment I thought that Kim and Ron would eventually need couple's therapy, but he turned out to be UN-Stoppable, as the series pointed out. It's not often shows produce bonds between characters, and the depth of the characters are amazing, especially considering it's mainly a comedy. In fact, even if we take away the exaggerated abilities of the two, they are great people, and I would date either of them if the chance arose. Thank you for such a lesson-teaching show. *bows*\n\nPhineas and Ferb Phineas and Ferb is an American animated comedy-musical television series. Originally broadcast as a one-episode preview on August 17, 2007 and again previewed on September 28, 2007, the series officially premiered on February 1, 2008 and ended on June 12, 2015 on Disney Channel, and follows Phineas ...read more. This should be number 1 and Gravity Falls should be number 2. This show is literally timeless, and the humor is great. Not to mention the songs in this show have no business to slap like they do, but they do. However Doofenshmirtz is what steals the show and is why this show is better than Gravity Falls In my opinion. As cool of a character as Bill was, Doof is one of my favorite cartoon villains easily. Regardless of wether you're a P&F or GF fan, however, both shows are miles better than most of the live action shows like Hannah Montana This should be first.. I love Phineas And Ferb because their plot is brilliant, they're funny, and they rock. I don't watch anything other than Phineas And Ferb on Disney, the Disney T.V. shows are now all dumb sitcoms, and Phineas and Ferb isn't. What I like about it is that anyone can watch it. For example, my 23 year old brother loves Phineas and Ferb, and my 5 year old cousin also loves Phineas and Ferb. What I also like about it is that they have those ' adult ' reference jokes, so older people would get attracted to the show as well. I love this show, and in my opinion, this show beats any show on Disney, it's humorous AND it inspires people to create anything they want. I love them! This show by far is the best of Disney. All other show's are very stupid in many ways. (sorry fans of other shows) Phineas and Ferb are clever, not clever BRILLIANT, and it's one of the things I most love of this show. Not like other shows that characters are dumb, specially parents. But Phineas and Ferb is way diffrent. The characters are animated but they are way more humans than series with actors. The songs are wonderful and catchy, and Phineas and Ferb teach us many important things like seize the day, be creative, use your imagination and be optimist and never give up. So Phineas and Ferb is a show that change my life for good and for bad. Yeah I'm a crazy fan And that's why for me phineas and Ferb is the best show of Disney. This should be first on the list there! It's the best show Disney's ever had! Phineas and Ferb is so awesome! I love every single character on here! Everyone's personality is so great and I absolutely love their songs and creativity. This is one show that's not afraid to be unique! I love Phineas's sweetness, Ferb's silence, Candace's craziness, Perry's mega-platypusness, and Doof's hilariousness. I also love sweet little Isabella and the Fireside Girls, and of course Baljeet and Buford. And Major Monogram and Carl rock! Vanessa and Stacy are awesome as well. I love all the agents and they have never failed! This show must stay on Disney forever and ever!\n\nThe Suite Life On Deck The Suite Life on Deck is an American sitcom that aired on Disney Channel from September 26, 2008 to May 6, 2011. It is a sequel/spin-off of the Disney Channel Original Series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. Now I'm hesitant to say I like this more than the og and before you scream at me let me explain. Both shows are amazing and are both creative but there are three reasons from this show that make it better than the og show. 1: the theme song come on you can't deny it's a head bopper because while the original is a classic this one is so much more catchy. 2: Debby Ryan, this is a disney channel all star and I'm not saying Ashley Tisdale is not good she's amazing and I too was sad that she was replaced by Debby but come on it was a great replacement. 3: we see Zack and Cody older on this show. Throughout the original we see Zack and Cody younger and by the end there were older but not for long enough. In this show they are older and have jokes and act older which is fun because people are funnier when there older (they were funny when they younger though TSLOD is the only show where the jokes were perfectly timed. Furthermore, this was one of the only shows where the actors seemed genuine. Unlike today's Disney stars, Cody Sprouse Dylan Sprouse Brenda Song... Were perfect for their roles.\n\n\n\nThis is because of the shows writers and directors who understand comedy, timing and a child's psyche. They were skilled. Now Disney has really gone down hill and to compensate with the lack of story and punchlines tell they are adding other 'superpowers' like in Lab Rats. Come on Disney. All of the new Disney show sucks, like shake it up, ant farm, Austin and ally, Jessie, dog with a blog, live and Maddie? They all stink, I don't know how anybody watches the.They are all so stupid and annoying and boring. They aren't funny and usually make lame jokes. The old ones like suite life and wowp are so god whered the good Disney shows go? The suite life was funny interesting show, I personally like on deck better but its just so much better than these new shows... It was such a funny show, I can't believe it ended so sadly... I mis all of them so much, I grew up with this show so end I cried so hard... I love esp the smart cody, playful zack, funny bailey and dumb London... All of them, thank you for the great show... They should also make a continual like college or something like that with all of previous characters, I m sure it would attract many people\n\nHannah Montana Hannah Montana, also known as Hannah Montana Forever for the fourth and final season, is an American musical comedy series created by Michael Poryes, Rich Correll, and Barry O'Brien which focused on Miley Stewart, a teenager living a double life as an average schoolgirl by day and a famous recording ...read more. Hannah Montana was a big part of my childhood. Miley was the perfect idol for 10 year old me and I still love her with all my heart. This show has shown the values of true friendship and family simultaneously being entertaining. It made us laugh and cry and I still consider it as one of the best shows ever made.\n\nSeeing the evolution of the show from season one to four and seeing the actors grow up is amazing.\n\n\n\nYou know when a show is spectacular if you look back at old scenes and they still make you cry. Hannah Montana is without a doubt the best show ever. I'm proud to say that I have been and always will be a Hannah Montana fan. This show absolutely sucks hard the show it biggest piece of crap for Disney who the heck put this here is were I would rank this show a 1/10 now here are my top 10 Disney shows\n\n10.Phieneas and Ferb\n\n9. Aladdin TAS\n\n8. Darkwing Duck\n\n7. Recess\n\n6. Gargoyals\n\n5. Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers\n\n4. Kim Possible\n\n3. Star vs The Force of Evil\n\n2. DuckTales\n\n1.Gravity Falls\n\nHELLO that's what its supposed to be not wizards crappy Hanna Montana stupid Jessie dumb Austin and ally bland Zack and Cody or boring good luck charlie What the heck! Number 9. Uh! NUMBER 9! Are you people CRAZY! It deserves to be #1 for sure nothing can compare to it not that's so raven, not Lizzie McGuire, no Jessie, Not the Jonas Brothers, not Wizards of Waverly Place, not Suite life of Zack and Cody or it's stupid spin off Suite Life on Deck, Not good luck charlie, not gravity falls, not Ant Farm, not Sonny with a chance, not Boy meets world, not girl meets world, not live and Maddie, not shake it up, not kickin it, not dog with a blog, not so random, not Andi Mack, not so weird, not bunk'd, not kc undercover, not lab rats, not Jett Jackson, not Dave the barbarian, not raven's home, not even Stevens, heck not even degrassi, icarly, victorious, zoey 101, big time rush, drake and Josh, Sam and Cat, neds declassified school survival guide, or any other dumb show that will ever come along. Hannah Montana will forever be the g.o.a.t. Miley is not known as the Disney Super Nova for no reason. She is the reason pop culture is the way it is today. She is what started it all especially for shows like Wizards, Jonas, and Sonny. There is also a reason she is more famous than all other Disney stars her show was the best and deserves the number 1 spot.\n\nJessie Jessie is an American sitcom that originally aired on Disney Channel from September 30, 2011 to October 16, 2015. The series was created and executive produced by Pamela Eells O'Connell and stars Debby Ryan as Jessie Prescott, a small town Texas girl who moves to New York City to try to become an actress, ...read more. 10 How is Jessie lower than Phineas and Ferb? Phineas and Ferb teaches kids the already debunked lesson that creativity should be limited and the Phineas and Ferb plot is too repetitive. However, the plot in Jessie is varied. In fact, the serious and positive messages outweigh the negative ones. Most importantly, this show teaches viewers to have faith in themselves because their families certainly have their backs. Another perfect example of a sitcom where laugh tracks are used after real jokes and not misused after the fake ones. While some people believe that the acting is poor, this show teaches important leadership lessons on how to cope with critical situations like when you are confronted with disrespectful people. This show is as good as Good Luck Charlie. Cameron Boyce's death literally made me sob that I literally wanted to binge watch this creative idea for a sitcom in order to honor his legacy and pay respect. This should be higher up. I love \"Jessie! \" It has been my favorite show on Disney Channel for the longest time. Most of the shows on Disney Channel, either are not entertaining, or the actors ruin the show completely. This show has brilliant actors who have brought the show to life! These actors have moved on to further shows because the show met the ending of the plot, and it reached maximum amount of seasons. It was continued an additional season because of the high ratings. The show has an amazing story line, and the actors portrayed the characters so well. The story is actually believable and was an amazing show while it lasted. I hope that one day one of the other shows will be as impressive as this one. But I would recommend: Austin and Ally, Liv and Maddie, Girl Meets World, Good Luck Charlie, Dog with a Blog, K.C. Undercover, Gravity Falls, Bunk'd, and Backstage! These haters should really go back and read some of the stuff they wrote because it's just ridiculous. I also love how they're stupid enough to put this show higher on the list than it would be by hating on it but my point is Jessie is a great show, much better than the new Disney like Bizaardvark, Best Friends Whenever, and Bunk'd. And I honestly don't know where people are coming from calling it \"racist,\" it's a kid's show for crying out loud if it were \"racist\" Disney wouldn't have it on the air in the first place. I've been watching for five years now and I highly recommend this program to anyone who hasn't seen it and likes fun storylines and laughs. JESSIE is the best Disney Channel show EVER! It's funny how Luke is always trying to get Jessie to date him but fails continuously, Emma always talking about one direction and fashion, Ravi being nerdy but polite, Zuri the sassy but sweet 10 year old, beartrum the sarcastic and lazy butler, and let's not forget about Beautiful, creative, boyfriend losing, JESSIE Prescott! I like that, despite of the utter craziness of the Ross kids, JESSIE never quits. I think that parents are just over protective of their kids and take this show seriously, and forget that this show is MAKE BELIEVE the characters are fake, made up, unreal, played by actors and actresses ( Debby Ryan, Peyton list, Cameron Boyce, skai Jackson, karan brar, Kevin Chamberlain) that can all MOSTLY act. OK for 5 and up. And better than Sam and Cat and my little pony. Thanks! A Disney Channel and Cameron Boyce and Peyton list and Zendaya fan!\n\nThe Contenders\n\nAustin & Ally Austin & Ally is an American teen sitcom that premiered on Disney Channel on December 2, 2011, and ended on January 10, 2016. The series was created by Kevin Kopelow & Heath Seifert, the writers and producers of the Disney Channel sitcoms Sonny with a Chance and Jonas. 11 Let me start out by asking a few questions regarding where this is placed. 1) Why is this higher than Lizzie McGuire, Even Stevens, Cory in the House and basically every other show on this list. I Don't quite understand how this show made the top 10 for best Disney Channel shows ever.\n\n\n\n2) What was going on in the person's head who made this show? I don't not think that this show deserves to be this high in the list. I am not saying that you are not in titled to your own opinion I am just saying that I don't particularly like this show.\n\n\n\nI am not actually bothered by many of the actors, hence the word \"by many\". There is really only one actor I hate on this show. Laura Morano. In my opinion I just don't really like her. I love Ross Lynch, and I am okay with Raini and Calum. Laura in my opinion can't sing. Her voice is like she is talking with just more breath behind her voice. She always makes the weirdest faces when she sings and smiles way to much and way to over the top ...more I must admit, I didn't like as much of the music and season 1. But then season 2 came, and BAM! Don't Look Down, You Can Come To Me, I Think About You, Finally Me- it trended on twitter! Austin & Ally is really one of the last good shows on Disney. There is so much character development- somehow this show also wounded up on the top 10 WORST Disney Channel shows, and one if the reasons is no character development which I don't understand. Ally overcame her stage fright, there is supposed to be an arc in which Austin starts writing songs, everyone (except Dez) is maturing just a little bit. It's not all rainbows and unicorns in it either- there is actually drama. And it has a purpose. It doesn't seem like it in the first episode- but they actually work to get where they are. As unrealistic as it is to be an overnight sensation, after all if that the team has to work. Unlike on Shake It Up, it might be just me, but lately it just seems like everything comes easy to them. On Jessie, I ...more I love Austin & Ally. It's so funny and entertaining. We have Austin, whom is a teenager that is propelled to stardom after he becomes an overnight internet sensation with the song Double Take. There's Ally, the brilliant and talented teenager whom is restricted to only writing songs because of her paralyzing stage fright. Because of this, Ally eventually decides to become Austin's songwriter. Then Trish, the girl with a loud fashion sense and attitude to match, who becomes Austin's manager. And Dez, the goofy and random redhead.\n\n\n\nThe cast all work so well together and it's always entertaining. Honestly, this show is just like any old 90's Disney sitcom. In stead of focusing on dumb, anorexic 13 year old girls, it actually have funny, interesting characters that aren't lame cliche stock characters, and pretty good music. It's child friendly, and the characters are amazing role models. Austin teaches us that with enough hard work and dedication, you can do almost anything. Ally teaches us that it never hurts to trust others and teamwork is essential. Trish teaches up that giving up is never the answer, and confidence takes you to high places. And Dez teaches us to not care what others may think of you\n\nLizzie McGuire Elizabeth Brooke McGuire, famously known as Lizzie, is the main character in the show. She is portrayed as a caring, rational, and cooperative person, although her animated alter-ego displays her true feelings from time to time. 12 Lizzie is really pretty and I've noticed that she was what a lot of girls back in the 2000s looked up to. I also like her little animated self, she's so cute.\n\nMiranda is really pretty as well.\n\nGordo is super cute, he's one the cutest Disney Channel male character of the 2000s. He's also really nice and supportive and that's why I like him.\n\nI wish the full episodes were uploaded on YouTube instead of just clips. How is good luck charlie higher than this? When I think Disney I think THIS SHOW, if there is one show where I think Disney got it absolutely right, it would be this show, the synopsis wasn't unrealistic, lizzie behaved her age and acted a like how any regular teenager would act, highschool was like highschool, and the show was both funny and charming, by far, this is Disney's best Lizzie McGuire was the best show of all time. Hilary duff is my role model and has been since I was a little kid. This was actually one of they're few shows that actually taught and meant something. They need to bring back shows like this. With starts that still respect themselves like Hilary duff did & does. She is one of the few childhood starts who grew up to not he a druggie or a \"sleeze\" Best single-cam-shot show on Disney Channel, I know they did the same thing with Zeke & Luther and Kirby Buckets, but This breaks the record for Disney Channel's best sitcom without a laugh track, This should've been the best live-action Disney Channel show, while Gravity Falls is the best Disney Channel cartoon.\n\nStar vs. the Forces of Evil \"Star vs. the Forces of Evil\" is an American animated television comedy produced by Disney Television Animation for Disney XD. It was created by Daron Nefcy and developed by Jordana Arkin and Dave Wasson. The series follows teenage magical princess from the dimension of Mewni Star Butterfly and her ...read more. 13 How is this (along with gravity falls) getting beat by these crappy sitcoms?! This is one of Disney's best works, if not number one! This show's animation is wonderful, the energetic tone is zany and fun to watch, the characters are likable and believable and the jokes may not be as funny as Gravity Falls's, but still are very memorable and for a good laugh. This show needs some more love, more love than those horrible sitcoms! It's a really great show in this garbage of bad animations. Yet, it has to improve. The plot is kinda feels like it does not exist in first few episodes but time to time, it will definitely get better. It is funny and very creative. I enjoy watching this show a lot. I consider it as Gravity Falls and Steven Universe's baby. If you like these shows, you will love it. I HATE shows without plot because I think it makes no sense. In last few episodes you can see character developments and leaks from the actual plot. I think it is starting now.\n\n\n\nTherefore, it grows on you, you either love or hate this show. If you have a child's spirit, I can guarantee that you will absolutely love this show which makes you feel yourself like a little kid again who waves a wand around and screams spells.\n\n\n\nIt has to improve to get better and I believe it will.\n\n\n\nP.S.: If you are a Fangirl, GO AND WATCH WITHOUT THINKING. THIS SHOW IS MADE FOR YOU, FOR US. AND SHIP STARCO! Eh. This show is a so so for me. I like silly cartoons and stuff, but this one is good and bad. I have trouble if I should continue watching it, or quit it. Help! Post reply for your Opinion so, I can chose YES or NO. The comment under me is right. star is SUPER awesome some shows like Sanjay and craig they don't have a plot they either A. have puking in every episode or B. they always do something nasty that leads to them getting cancelled\n\nSonny With a Chance Sonny with a Chance is an American sitcom created by Steve Marmel which aired for two seasons on Disney Channel from February 8, 2009 to January 2, 2011. The series follows the experiences of teenager Sonny Munroe, portrayed by Demi Lovato, who becomes the newest accepted cast member of her favorite ...read more. 14 Sonny With a Chance is an awesome (maybe even the best) Disney Channel show for a couple of reasons. The cast is really talented. Demi Lovato played a happy, ambitious, positive character extremely well. but at the time she was really suffering. Tiffany Thornton and Sterling Knight are really kind and sweet in real life but when you see some of their scenes, you'll think they're really jerks. Brandon Smith and Doug Brochu have excellent comedic timing (the whole cast does) and make Nico and Grady best friends for life. Allisyn Arm perfectly gives Zora her quirk and weird charm. Sterling and Demi also have amazing chemistry that'll make you ship Channy for sure. The episodes are very funny but also have a good lesson as well. Sonny is a great role model for kids as well. Sonny With a Chance should be on the top ten and I'm upset it isn't. Demi Lovato does a great job with this show and she was going through tough times and I think Zora is one of the BEST characters from disney channel ever she's hilarious! I think that this may be the best Disney Channel show till date. The characters are done very well. Sonny is a great role model as she is kind and is willing to give everyone a second chance. The acting was amazing. Some people think Chad is a jerk, but I really think he has a great character arc and I love how he becomes a better person for Sonny. The same goes for Tawnie. Honestly, this should be #1. I love Demi Lovato. She's such a good singer and actress. The whole cast is funny. This is one of the few shows that doesn't have a fake background and cheesy unwell played actors. The shows all must have taken time to make just showing from how well the lines are written and portrayed. I really think this show deserves to be number 1!\n\nRecess Recess is an American animated television series created by Paul Germain and Joe Ansolabehere and produced by Walt Disney Television Animation, with animation done by Grimsaem, Plus One Animation, Sunwoo Animation, and Toon City. 15 I wish they still had the old generation of Disney Channel airing! I loved all those shows from my childhood and it makes me pissed off that even Disney has gone into this garbage the media created. Surprisingly this and Kim possible are some of the only ones I remember watching all the time. Also, just found my favourite video game actress, Ashley Johnson, played Gretchen. Huh. Come on' guys! This was the best show ever made! Do YOU know any other shows where the main characters are best friends who, no matter what, stand up for what they believe in? TJ is my hero! I ' loved recess. My heart was broken when they got rid of Disney cinemagic because it meant that they would stop showing this and Kim possible. I found all the characters really relatable too\n\nLiv and Maddie Liv and Maddie is a live-action Disney Channel sitcom that started on July 19, 2013, and ended on March 24, 2017. It is about two identical twin sisters named Olivia \"Liv\" Rooney and Madison \"Maddie\" Rooney (both portrayed by actress Dove Olivia Cameron; born in January 1996 as Chloe Celeste Hosterman) ...read more. 16 14...14? This show excels in story/plot, characters, character development, jokes, soundtrack, emotion, and messages. The best T.V. show of all time. Let me elaborate:\n\n\n\nPlot: The plot is about identical twin sisters with opposing personalities who are best friends. They stick together through thick and thin. This show is also about the importance of family and friendship. In every episode, there is a lesson about life. No matter what they go through, they always make it out together.\n\n\n\nCharacters: Liv is the girly twin who is a former actress, and Maddie is the tomboy twin who plays basketball. Both roles are played by Dove Cameron, who has the personalities of both characters combined. She does the perfect job. Also in the twins' family are their brothers Joey and Parker, and parents Pete and Karen. Parker gets lots of great lines. He is the definition of \"deadpan snarker\". The mother Karen is very funny as well. She was especially funny in the episode ...more I'm actually astounded this is below Jessie. This show was beautiful. It wasn't another one of those crappy sitcoms. For once we have a new Disney show with actual in depth characters and funny jokes. Dove Cameron is spectacular and I laugh nearly every episode. THE BEST T.V. show of ALL TIME! This show is heartwarming and adorable! The show is really sweet and is about a pair of identical twin sisters with opposing personalities who are best friends, and they're always helping each other out! They stick together through thick and thin, no matter what! And through every challenge they face, they always make it out with each other! Not to mention they teach some very valuable lessons to both the audience of the show and the people around them! First, there was an episode where Liv says \"fear is just another reason to try harder\". Then, there was an episode where Liv, Maddie, and their friends confront a group of boys at their school who were rating the girls based on their looks, and Liv says that \"you don't have to change who you are to fit someone else's needs\". She even comes up with a song about it! Finally, there was an episode where Liv and her friends work together to break the stereotype that girls only like girl ...more I love liv and maddie! I don't just like their shows but I love liv's songs especially you and me and the beat! I love maddies character! She never takes no for an answer and she won't give up on anything! I love how live and maddie have a connection with each other! Parker makes me laugh! He will take any challenge! Joey makes me laugh! He will do anything to get a girl. There is one or person that in want to talk about. Willow makes me laugh! She is a good friend to maddie but she will do anything to go out with Joey.\n\nLab Rats Lab Rats, also known as Lab Rats: Bionic Island for the fourth season, is an American television sitcom that premiered on February 27, 2012, on Disney XD, and aired through February 3, 2016. The series was created by Chris Peterson and Bryan Moore and produced by It's a Laugh Productions for Disney ...read more. 17 What I like about this show is it actually has a plot. It has an antagonist, at least one new one per season, protagonists, good actors/actresses, and the jokes are original and actually pretty funny. The show has morals just like any other show, and I like how the parents aren't brainless, or nonexistent. Lab Rats should be way higher, it's a big step for Disney. The show's plot, which is centered around bionics, thickens as the show goes around, and the fight scenes aren't cheesy. There's the occasional cliche or stereotype, but compared to shows like Austin and Ally, you barely notice them. I can't believe lab rats is at 22 it should be within the top 5. It has a mix if thrill, action, comedy, and family problems that are so out of this world. I especially like the character Adam played by Spencer Boldman. Soencer is doing a great job showing Adams personality as a caring, sometimes mean, and funny brother. My favorite character is Leo. He ties the whole family together. He is the little brother that no one believes but everyone cares for. He is the only kid in the Davenport family that doesn't have biotic but seems to hang on without them even though he wishes he has them he has a great developing mind which will probably lead to a great part of the next season or end if the season This show is awesome! It's characters act real and everyone has a personality. It has people problems and hero problems. Every episode had an individual plot but there is also an overarching plot. There are actual dangerous villains, who also have personality and aren't just people that do evil stuff because the show needs a plot. It's actually very real. Not every bad person is brought to justice and some bad things happen to good, innocent people. There are very few characters that I don't enjoy on screen. Very few clich\u00e9s are ever used which is great. I could go on and on about every aspect of the show but if you haven't seen it then you are living under a rock. Watch it. You'll be happy you did! Lab rats is an amazing show! There is lots of suspense, mystery and exciting fighting scenes. I like how at the beginning there bionics is a secret then later the whole world knows about it, which gives the, lots of problems but they overcome it as a family. I also love how funny Adam is in the show even in the most tense situations he always makes a joke. Lab rats then continues into Lab Rate bionic island and then combines with Mighty Med to create Lab rats Elite Force. If you haven't seen the show you really should!\n\nPhil of the Future Phil of the Future is an American science fiction sitcom that originally aired on Disney Channel from June 18, 2004, to August 19, 2006, for two seasons. 18 I loved Phil of the future, I could relate to it cause I have an older brother. We always fight and it seem like we hate each other but he is my bro so I love him! The show was really interesting and funny. I loved it, the best show ever! Are you kidding me? Phil of the Future below like Austin and Ally, ANT Farm, Dog with a Blog, and Shake it Up? Some 13 year old girl created this list, I swear. People don't know real T.V. at all. How is Dog with a Blog above this. Phil of the Future is hands down the best Disney Channel show ever. Pim was the best, I loved her! Phil was hot and the show was just overall the most entertaining. Childhood memories! Wrote my 3rd grade eassy around it 86%. I changed the names of phil and keeley and wrote about the first episode. Good thing the teacher never heard about that cartoon.\n\nShake It Up Shake It Up (sometimes stylized as Shake It Up!) is an American sitcom that originally aired on Disney Channel in the United States from November 7, 2010 to November 10, 2013. Created by Chris Thompson and starring Bella Thorne and Zendaya, the show follows the adventures of CeCe Jones (Bella Thorne) ...read more. 19 I don't know why this show gets SO MUCH hate! First, the theme song is AMAZING ! The characters are all so lovable and every episode is entertaining to watch. It will always have a special place in my childhood and heart <3 Worst Disney Channel show ever, seriously, it makes Jessie look like Game of Thrones. The main characters are too mean to each other, there's too much gross-out humour, and overused play-tracks (which is a huge fault of Disney Channel), and the fact that they joked about an eating disorder IN A KIDS SHOW is a low, even for Disney standards. This is the worst Disney show ever! This show ripped off Hannah Montana which was bad enough. CeCe is too inappropriate and is a troublemaker. Rocky is a cry baby and she acts like a 1 year old. And Flin (CeCe's brother) is a brat that won't shut his mouth he also cries for stupid reasons. I wish The person who created this show will get fired one day and I wish I could kill the cast of this abomination. Thank god this show was cancelled in 2013 and taken of Disney in 2014. This show is TERRIBLE. This belongs at number 100! The acting makes me wanna barf, and Cece doesn't even act like a normal teen. I can't believe Zendaya would waste her talent on this show! She is an amazing dancer and actress, and she wastes her time on a 'famous' show called \"Shake It Up Chicago.\" They can't even dance! If you call moving your hands up and down and stomping your feet \"talent\" then you are CRAZY. Flynn is so annoying. I like Gunther and Tinka because they are funny, but I wanna punch the screen when Cece is on. Ugh. And it's so predictable - there's some \"life lesson\" at the end which is TOO obvious. Please. Just no.\n\nDuckTales DuckTales is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. It premiered on September 18, 1987 and ended on November 28, 1990 with a total of four seasons and 100 episodes. 20 I Am going to sing the ducktales song ready set go, Life is like a hurricane here in Duckburg\n\nRace cars, lasers, aeroplanes, it's a duck-blur!\n\nMight solve a mystery\n\nOr rewrite history! DuckTales! Woo-oo!\n\nEveryday they're out there making\n\nDuckTales! Woo-oo!\n\nTales of derring do-bad and good\n\nLuck Tales! Woo-oo! D-d-d-danger! Watch behind you!\n\nThere's a stranger out to find you\n\nWhat to do, just grab on to some... ducktales woo hoo Not pony tales or cotton tales, no,\n\nDuckTales! Woo-oo! I love ducktales as well and used to watch it on toon Disney Excuse me? Why isn't Ducktales above Wizards of Waverly Place? Get Ducktales up to number 1. Disney Channel doesn't deserve to make more sitcoms more than cartoons. Ducktales is not a Disney Channel television series\n\n\n\nFrom 1987 to 1989, Ducktales aired on syndication\n\n\n\nIn 1990, it aired in the syndicated block, The Disney Afternoon I loved this show when I was a kid.\n\nBoy Meets World 21 How is this not #1. Its actually funny and characters like Cory, Shawn, Mr. Feeny, and Eric, and Topanga make this an all time classic. Girl Meets World is the garbage spinoff. It's sad to know that Boy Meets World isn't at least in the top 5. A lot of kids nowadays have never even heard of this show and honestly heartbreaking to hear. BMW is probably one of my favorite shows ever. It was actually focused on the importance of love, life, family and friendship, not going to high school at 11, having magical powers or becoming famous... I feel like a lot of kids and families can relate to what happened in every episode. Also, the jokes weren't overused and cocky, like in most of the shows now. How is Boy Meets World not number 1? All the shows now is very overrated and stupid. Boy Meets World ACTUALLY teaches lessons. All the characters were realistic and each of them had realistic lives. The parents in T.V. shows now are literally dumb on purpose for entertainment like no. the parents in boy meets world were realistic and treated their kids fair and knew what was right for their kids. Also this show was so hilarious (ERIC DUH). Are you kidding me. ARe yOu kidDiNg ME!?! This show is #23!? This is one of the best shows on television. It taught important life lessons, it was funny, and wasn't afraid to get a little real at times. Topanga and Corey are the bomb. Watch it on ABC Family, it is so much better than Girl Meets World, Austin and Ally, ANT Farm, Jessie, and all other dumb new shows combined.\n\nGirl Meets World Girl Meets World is an American coming of age television sitcom. The series made its debut on Disney Channel on June 27, 2014. 22 Girl Meets World should be higher up in fact it should be number 1. I know a lot of people hate it but it really affects some people and makes them a lot happier and make them a better person. It has helped me and my friend because at first we were down all the time and we weren't happy but the life lessons they teach are actually amazing and help a lot. They almost never have episodes that are copies of other shows and you don't see the same boring, lame, cheesy things you see in most kids shows. This show has changed my life it's seriously underrated and I love it and I wish I could tell Rowan, Sabrina, Corey, Peyton, Ben, Danielle, and August thank you so much. I hope the people who don't like it actually watch it and see how amazing and inspiring it is. I love it when Girl Meets World teaches so much not just about knowledge about life in general! The metaphors they make connects the lessons to the real life world which not only them as characters can understand but us as the audience can relate to. It is a beautifully constructed show and I'm sorry Lucaya all the way! The connection between the characters are so strong and the random flashbacks to Boy meet World is amazing. If you like Disney shows this is definitely not one that you should skip out on because Girl meets world makes life lessons entertaining and I think that anyone no matter what age will enjoy the show. It's basically my life. I love it like no other. It's an amazing show and has changed my life for the best. It's actually not only a show to me, it means a lot more. It has taught me a lot of things, has been life changing for me. I can relate so much to Riley. Fun, quirky, annoying, funny, solicitous on the outside but insecure, scared, afraid and unpredictable on the inside. Every character, I can relate to, but Riley is mostly. Some episodes such as GMRileytown, GMForgivnessProject, GMAChristmasMaya made me cry a ton and affected me, caused me to be more into the character's shows. I can relate a lot and it brightens up my day just by seeing their (the cast's) faces. I definitely want it to be #1 because it impacted and influenced me so much, made me an even better person, made me smile in my rough times, etc. Girl Meets World and Gravity Falls are the only shows I watch on T.V. now. The casting for GMW is absolutely amazing. Rowan Blanchard is the perfect role for the quirky, adorable Riley Matthews, daughter of Cory and Topanga. Sabrina Carpenter plays Maya Hart, who is a trouble maker at first glance, but has family problems, just as Shawn Hunter did. Not to mention the adorable August Maturo, who plays Riley's little brother. This show is amazing because it teaches the audience so much. Although some episodes are the same as episodes from Boy Meets World, I think it's important that they're reintroducing those ideas into the kids of this generation.\n\nCory in the House Cory in the House is a television show, which aired on the Disney Channel from January 12, 2007, to September 12, 2008, and was a spin-off from the Disney show That's So Raven. 23 BEST ANIME EVER! This should be number 1 in this list and also the top 10 greatest animes list. The anime seems to continue where the manga left off. Even the fights R awesome. My favorite moment in the anime was seeing Cory unleash a power so much stronger than Super Saiyan Blue to defeat Stickler. This anime should definitely continue. I don't understand why this isn't on the top ten anime list. This is the greatest anime of all time with the best anime character, Cory! This show is extremely well written with amazing characters and hot hentai. Beautiful show. My favorite. I remember when the pilot aired. My gran was suffering through cancer. During one of her surgeries, she had a heart attack and a nosebleed. I thought she was a goner. Then, one of the nurses turned on the T.V., and black Jesus we know as Cory came. Just after, my gran came back to life. Not only that, but her sore hip was better too. This anime got me through tough times and I just have to say... OBAMA RIPPED OFF THIS SHOW! I love cory in the house its very funny. I love the episode when Raven came to visit in the white house. I really liked it very much.\n\nLilo & Stitch: The Series Lilo & Stitch: The Series is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television. 24 Some of the shows above this are worse, such as Hannah Montana. Why is Hannah Montana above this and other older shows? It is funny and I could watch it 10 times without getting slightly bored! Probably the best cartoon on the list. Some of the other cartoons like Star vs. the Forces of Evil are just weird. I used to watch the episodes online all the time in like 4th grade. This show was great.", "images": ["https://www.thetoptens.com/favicon.ico", "https://static.thetoptens.com/logo100.jpg", "https://static.thetoptens.com/img/lists/95974.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thetoptens.com/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thetoptens.com/disney-channel/best-disney-channel-television-series/", "title": "Best Disney Channel Shows", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Best Disney Channel Shows", "url": "https://www.thetoptens.com/disney-channel/best-disney-channel-television-series/", "site_name": "TheTopTens"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 163057887059389}, "theme-color": "#888485"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.thetoptens.com", "summary": ""}
