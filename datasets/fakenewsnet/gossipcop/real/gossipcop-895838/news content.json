Our Black Friday deals guide covers everything you know to know, such as the date, how to get the best deals, what offers you can expect, and what happened at this year's Black Friday sale event.\n\n\n\nBlack Friday 2022 falls on November 25 this year, but like years past, we expect to see deals start to pop up as early as October. At last year's Black Friday sale, we saw offers earlier than ever thanks to sales launched by retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart as they tried to combat shipping delays and supply issues. In fact, according to Adobe Analytics, spending was actually down 1.3% on Black Friday proper compared to last year, but if you looked at November as a whole, consumers spent $109.8 billion, which was up 11.9% compared to 2020.\n\n\n\nThis also aligns with what we saw - the best deals were launched in the weeks leading up to Black Friday, and we were left disappointed with offers on the big day. Consumers were also worried about product availability, so they took advantage of early Black Friday deals offered by the big-name online retailers. Early holiday shopping was a smart move as we noticed best-selling items like the AirPods Pro, the Apple Watch 6, MacBooks, and Amazon's own devices were out of stock in the run-up to Black Friday proper. We also saw price increases on certain items, including the AirPods Pro and MacBook Pro, which is unusual based on previous years.\n\n\n\nSo what were last year's hottest Black Friday deals? According to Amazon, the Echo Dot, Fire TV Stick, Echo Show 5, AirPods, Beats Studio Buds, and the Revlon one-step hair dryer rounded up the top-sellers. Adobe also reported that laptops, TVs, the Nintendo Switch, the Apple Watch, and toys from brands like Hot Wheels, Nerf, and Paw Patrol were this year's Black Friday best-sellers. We expect a mix of that during the Black Friday 2022 deals event, plus new gadgets released this year.\n\n\n\nBelow you'll find more on our predictions for this year's sale as well how to find the best Black Friday deals, the best Black Friday retailers, and looking back at this year's top offers. We'll be updating this page with all the latest Black Friday 2022 news, so make sure to bookmark this page as your one-stop-shop for Black Friday.\n\nWhen is Black Friday 2022? When is Black Friday 2022? The official Black Friday date for this year is November 25, 2022. The actual date shifts every year, but the day of the week stays the same: it's always the Friday after Thanksgiving.\n\n\n\nAt last year's sale, retailers kicked off their Black Friday deals earlier than ever due to concerns around shipping delays and supply issues. We also saw more retailers moving to the competitive arena of online sales, which resulted in more deals to shop on the web.\n\nHow do I get the best Black Friday deals in 2022?\n\nHomework really helps. Some retailers up prices from August through to October so they can offer supposedly amazing discounts on Black Friday, so don\u2019t be fooled by such moves.\n\nThey\u2019re particularly prevalent in expensive consumer electronics such as TVs or laptops with product numbers rather than names, with products that were dropped down to a great bargain price suddenly being pushed back to their MSRP again.\n\nIt\u2019s also a very good idea to be flexible: for example, if you fancy a Samsung UHD TV it\u2019s best to think about the features you want rather than a specific model number: the BRV553ABD34-82C-9218-X may not be discounted on Black Friday 2022, but an almost identical set with the specification you want probably will be.\n\nSo do your research on what matters and we\u2019ll do our best to give you the right comparison needed.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that something that looks like a five-star set is the same but cheaper - certain elements (often with regards to screen quality or image processing) won\u2019t be as high quality to achieve that lower price point.\n\nBlack Friday deals 2022: our predictions\n\nWe can make predictions of what we think Black Friday 2022 will bring based on last year's sale event. Due to concerns around shipping delays and supply issues, we saw retailers like Best Buy and Walmart launch Black Friday deals earlier than ever, with Amazon kicking things off in early October.\n\n\n\nTypically retailers reserve their best deals for Black Friday proper, but last year we saw the best deals leading up to Black Friday. This might be why, according to Adobe Analytics, spending was down 1.3% on Black Friday compared to last year, and Thanksgiving Day stayed flat. Consumers have spent $109.8 billion in November alone, which was up significantly (11.9%) compared to 2020. This falls in line with the trend of early sales, which drew consumers to make earlier purchases and not wait for Black Friday to snag a deal online.\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean for Black Friday 2022? It all depends on if retailers will face the same shipping and stock supply issues that plagued this year's sale. We do expect the trend of earlier sales to stay, but if stock issues aren't a problem, we think retailers will reserve their best deals for Black Friday proper to help keep the hype around Black Friday alive.\n\n\n\nWhile it's still early to know exactly what kind of deals we'll see at this year's sale, we can make predictions on what brands and products we'll see come November. According to Adobe, the hottest items at last year's Black Friday sale included AirPods, the Apple Watch, laptops, TVs, consoles, and toys from brands like Hot Wheels, Paw Patrol, and Nerf. Amazon's top Black Friday sellers consisted of its own devices like the Echo Dot, Fire TV Stick, and smart bulbs, and some interesting items included the Revlon one-step hair dryer and the Colorfulkoala yoga pants.\n\n\n\nWe expect Apple devices, toys, laptops, TVs, and Amazon's own devices to be top sellers at the Black Friday 2022 sale and new gadgets that will be released this year.\n\nWhy is it called Black Friday\n\nLet\u2019s take a history lesson to find how why they call it Black Friday: the first known mention of Black Friday related to this shopping experience was in November 1951, when the journal Factory Management and Maintenance used it to describe people calling in sick the day after Thanksgiving so they could have an extra day off work.\n\nAt the same time, US police were using the phrases \u201cBlack Friday\u201d and \u201cBlack Saturday\u201d to describe the horrendous traffic that occurred at the beginning of the pre-Christmas shopping season.\n\nIn 1961, the local government moved to change the shopping season to \u201cBig Friday\u201d and \u201cBig Saturday,\u201d but it never caught on. The notion that it was the time when retailers moved 'back into the black' was seen far later and clearly an attempt to bring positivity to the term.\n\nImage credit: TechRadar\n\nThe best Black Friday deals from last year's sale\n\nTaking a look back at last year's Black Friday deals can help us get an idea of what will be on sale during Black Friday 2022.
