In a video obtained by TMZ, you can see the \u201cRocket Man\u201d hitmaker lean over and yell, \u201cF*** off\u201d off-mic.\n\nThe iconic British singer tries to continue unfazed, but as the touching persists, he becomes increasingly agitated, repeatedly screaming \u201cF*** off\u201d at the touchy-feely concertgoer.\n\nJohn eventually gets up and exits the stage as his live band continues playing in the background.\n\nDavid Furnish Talks Elton John\u2019s Retirement And The Royal Wedding\n\nThe fans returned to their seats, many of them confused over what had happened. John later returned to continue the show but told those in attendance there would be, \u201cNo more coming on stage during \u2018Saturday Night\u2019. You f***ed it up.\u201d\n\nJohn elaborated on the incident in a statement shared on his official Twitter on Saturday.\n\nA statement from Elton. pic.twitter.com/Cdd7jqjPZt \u2014 Elton John (@eltonofficial) March 3, 2018\n\nLast month, the \u201cTiny Dancer\u201d singer announced he is retiring from live-touring after his Farewell, Yellow Brick Road World Tour, which will run until 2020.\n\nJohn is scheduled to continue his Vegas residency until May 19, 2018.", "images": ["https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/global.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-664240742.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/162592_8754.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=90", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1384867282.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/royals-brick-340x150-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/ofy7npnbai-2nl2qwcfrt/ETC031522CelebEstateStallone.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/elton.png?w=720&h=480&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/awards-banner-350x150.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/corus.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=82", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1370864867.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/OTWAliceandMaster02.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/cj058gk7ve-j85qdlk7px/ETC031522TBTJulietteLewisBestRoles01.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/ad-choices.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gettyimages-652371190.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/newsletter/newsletter-large.jpg", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1238909632.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/thumbnail_brick-340x150-1.jpeg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1354160954.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1238909632.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/3yzy074ydc-hdhxiluc50/A11_Ben_Affleck_JLo_Spain_and_Deep_Water.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/3l46mqci6d-epaiw19ua7/ETC0315TheLostCityPremiere.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60"], "top_img": "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gettyimages-652371190.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martin Holmes"], "canonical_link": "https://etcanada.com/news/305042/elton-john-explains-why-he-stormed-off-stage-during-las-vegas-concert/", "title": "Elton John Explains Why He Stormed Off Stage During Las Vegas Concert", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "x4SpOp2Us67I6MlQN2uFse9KXvwgu1d8_r5F2qkIbYc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 5.9.2", "title": "Elton John Explains Why He Stormed Off Stage During Las Vegas Concert", "author": "Martin Holmes", "description": "It doesn't have to be a Saturday night to put Elton John in a fighting mood and he proved that on Thursday when he took issue with a \"handsy\" fan and stormed off stage mid-concert.
