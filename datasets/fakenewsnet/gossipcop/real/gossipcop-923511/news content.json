They\u2019re pretty strict. Two phone calls a week, 10 minutes [for each phone call].\u201d\n\nEdwards\u2019 father, Larry, added that the reality star \u201cjust knew he needed to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe picked the [rehab] place. He wants to do better, he wants to get better,\u201d Larry explained.\n\nJen added, \u201cIt is a relapse or a slip, whatever they want to call it. I think that\u2019s why he realized before it gets out of control he needs to get a hold on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was about to spiral bad,\u201d Standifer said. \u201cRight before he left he said his kids deserve to have the healthiest dad.

I\u2019m not sure what Maci\u2019s talked to him about or what he\u2019s heard, but I haven\u2019t told her that he\u2019s back in rehab.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to Bentley and explain to him: Just because you\u2019re an addict doesn\u2019t make you a bad person,\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t really know how much to tell a 9\u00bd-year-old.\u201d (Bentley was 9\u00bd at the time of filming but turned 10 on Oct. 27.)\n\nLarry said he had no qualms about being open with Bentley about his father\u2019s struggles with addiction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be totally honest [with Bentley], that\u2019s my plan,\u201d Larry explained. \u201cBut I want him to hear it from us first before he hears it from anybody else.\u201d\n\nEdwards checked into rehab in early October, according to Us Weekly.
