I am heartbroken. I am still in disbelief,\u201d Crystal said.\n\n\u201cWe laid him to rest Saturday. He is in the place he was always certain he wanted to spend eternity.\u201d\n\nHefner died of natural causes at his home surrounded by family on Wednesday night. He was laid to rest at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, right next to Marilyn Monroe's burial spot which he bought in 1992 for $75k.\n\n\u201cHe was an American hero. A pioneer. A kind and humble soul who opened up his life and home to the world.\u201d\n\nThe aspiring DJ was Hefner\u2019s third wife. The couple wed in December 2012.\n\nAccording to reports Crystal will inherit nothing from her late husband\u2019s multi-million dollar fortune because of an ironclad prenuptial agreement and the fact that Hugh never added her to his will.\n\nRegardless Crystal continued to praise Hef saying she always felt how much he loved her.\n\n\u201cI felt how much he loved me. I loved him so much. I am so grateful. He gave me life. He gave me direction. He taught me kindness. I will feel eternally grateful to have been by his side, holding his hand, and telling him how much I love him,\u201d Crystal told People.\n\n\u201cHe changed my life, he saved my life. He made me feel loved every single day. He was a beacon to the world, a force unlike anything else. There never has and never will be another Hugh M. Hefner.\u201d\n\nREAD THE FULL STATEMENT HERE\n\n", "images": ["https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10142/234605d608f94f1292abd4aa449756b8.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/957/3ff9f4f18d7b4ed49ea760710f679f20.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3276/79073f716a4e4543b6c90f35e180086f.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/178/bfbb4f4ed0d041fa8ee7aeb140acc103.jpeg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/979/c2b516a30c6b4be3a16a2662b43b87c9.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7017/7c27bcfc95b149e3a1e01fa7644d8599.png", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4403/6759ada4a32a42dc80657b20753c336b.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7017/5b673d720fca42b991d8f6421efed5ea.png", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/180/07caeda8d8c24150bb28ec8cacc5661e.jpeg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8407/23a1b651dcf346928ef353e5c2eff539.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10095/162bc878db9b47d1bed7dca554e5574c.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10095/1e5d1bfb48cb4c40919790041ca5889a.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10142/edda81dd8c96421184dafa3a9d807c5e.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1280/bed85fca502d4c4396da6c72b0bffe7c.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1128/116df9619a524b08b7c2577bc1748212.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7017/0c69e7f5abab4654a0673d13f24315d4.png", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10142/e7210280e24b4cc0bae077af99952962.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10142/36363d3522844779b5f12f3edab7f73a.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/182/315935c6fce946e89504ea65708b8211.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10095/5690ba4019c4401987c3e8d0c26d4041.svg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4403/6759ada4a32a42dc80657b20753c336b.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.news24.com/Channel/crystal-hefner-breaks-her-silence-after-hughs-death-20171003", "title": "Crystal Hefner breaks her silence after Hugh\u2019s death", "meta_data": {"mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "News24", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "default", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "red", "msapplication-TileColor": "red", "msapplication-TileImage": "~/images/pwa/news24/mstile-150x150.png", "application-name": "News24", "msapplication-tooltip": "News24.
