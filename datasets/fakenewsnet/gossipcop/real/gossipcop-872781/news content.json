Not only are the reality star\u2019s house-flipping and design businesses thriving, but he and his partner of eight years Gage Edward are also busy raising their 9-month old daughter, Monroe Christine.\n\nLewis explains: \u201cZoila retired about three months ago. She stayed the first six months we had the baby, which is amazing. You know, she\u2019s wanted to retire for two years now, and she\u2019s been with me for 18 years. I just begged her, begged her, begged her \u2014 \u2018Please stay. I need help with the baby. I need help with this transition.\u2019 And she stayed as long as she could.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhysically, after doing that kind of work for all of these years, it really takes its toll,\u201d Lewis continued. \u201cShe\u2019s 68 years old. She looks 10 years younger, because I gave her all that plastic surgery. But she\u2019s tired and she\u2019s ready to go.\u201d\n\nHe and Chavez have certainly had their ups and downs over Flipping Out\u2018s 10 seasons. Not afraid to push back from time to time, Chavez\u2019s sassy and stubborn attitude often landed her on the receiving end of Lewis\u2019 famously short temper. In a season 9 episode, she was almost fired after walking out and refusing to return right as Lewis was preparing to leave for an important business trip.\n\n\u201cYou better think real carefully about what you\u2019re doing right now because there\u2019ll be no going back,\u201d Lewis warned her in a tense voicemail. \u201cAnd I promise you\u2014there\u2019ll be no going back.\u201d\n\nOf course, the duo made up and Chavez is back in the Lewis household for season 10, working part-time two days a week. Viewers will get to see her road to retirement throughout the milestone season.\n\nSo what exactly has Chavez been doing since leaving? \u201cMost of her family is in Nicaragua, so the first thing she did when she retired is she went to Nicaragua for five, six weeks,\u201d Lewis explained. \u201cNow she\u2019s back and we\u2019re texting \u2014 she has a daughter who lives in Koreatown, so she\u2019s staying with her.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jeff Lewis Introduces His New Intern: His Daughter Monroe!\n\nAnd in case there was any doubt, Lewis was quick to stress that Chavez is not out of his life \u2014 though Flipping Out viewers might see a whole new life for Lewis this season.\n\n\u201cWhen the baby came, everything changed. Everything changed. Our home life, our business life \u2014 everything has been shaken up in a good way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt forces you to kind of grow and assess what\u2019s working in your life and what\u2019s not working in your life. Also, it\u2019s not about my life anymore, it\u2019s about the baby\u2019s life. All these decisions we make are about what\u2019s good for the baby. And I\u2019m used to making decisions about what\u2019s good for Jeff. So it\u2019s kind of a new life.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F248515971_423792849226570_1672372709981615183_n.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F10%2Fjeff-zoila.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F10%2Fjeff-zoila.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F10%2Fjeff-zoila.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn", "August"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/home/zoila-chavez-jretired-jeff-lewis/", "title": "Jeff Lewis' Housekeeper Zoila Chavez Has Retired After 18 Years", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Exclusive,Flipping Out,Jeff Lewis,News", "news_keywords": "Exclusive,Flipping Out,Jeff Lewis,News", "description": "But after nearly two decade as Flipping Out star Jeff Lewis' housekeeper, Zoila Chavez has finally retired", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Jeff Lewis' Housekeeper Zoila Chavez Has Retired After 18 Years", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/home/zoila-chavez-jretired-jeff-lewis/", "description": "But after nearly two decade as Flipping Out star Jeff Lewis' housekeeper, Zoila Chavez has finally retired", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F10%2Fjeff-zoila.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/home/zoila-chavez-jretired-jeff-lewis/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F10%2Fjeff-zoila.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/home/zoila-chavez-jretired-jeff-lewis/", "title": "Jeff Lewis' Housekeeper Zoila Chavez Has Retired After 18 Years", "description": "But after nearly two decade as Flipping Out star Jeff Lewis' housekeeper, Zoila Chavez has finally retired", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F10%2Fjeff-zoila.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/home/zoila-chavez-jretired-jeff-lewis/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
