Cyrus, 24, wore a black and multi-colored floral dress from Maria Escote\u2019s Spring 2018 ready-to-wear collection with blue mascara and Liam, 27, looked dapper in a black suit and color coordinated tie.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n202DC694 Credit: Michael Buckner/Variety/Shutterstock\n\nMeanwhile, leading man Chris, 34, dressed in a cobalt blue suit with open collar dress shirt.

I don\u2019t like when relationships are two halves trying to make a whole,\u2019 The Voice judge told Stern during his first appearance on his radio show. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t think that I have that co-dependency. I think people that break up and get back together, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nthor-ragnarok Cate Blanchett, Mark Ruffalo and Tessa Thompson | Credit: FeatureflashSHM/Shutterstock; Matt Baron/Shutterstock; Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP\n\nAdding, \u201cYou get time to be yourself. You get time to grow up. I think if you\u2019re growing up attached to another person, you never really get solid as your own being.\u201d\n\nAlso at the Thor: Ragnarok premiere were the film\u2019s stars Cate Blanchett (in Gucci), Mark Ruffalo and Tessa Thompson (in Schiaparelli).", "images":
