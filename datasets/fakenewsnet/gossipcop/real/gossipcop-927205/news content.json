We're told she was there to finalize her application for a UK visa.\n\nThe whole thing only took about 10 minutes, and the entire office was cleared for her. We're told she was friendly with the staff. As for her disguise -- shades and a White Sox cap to blend in with locals.\n\nMeghan forked over about $1,500, maybe a little more, for premium processing -- so she should get her visa within a few days ... according to our sources.\n\nBased on the visa application criteria, she most likely submitted for a family visa, and applied as a partner or spouse. That visa requires her to confirm all previous marriages, and her plans to marry or become a civil partner within 6 months of arriving in the UK.\n\nWe can hear her now ... \"Maybe you've heard of my fiance.\"", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/fd/16by9/2022/03/15/fd42a92af0794dba86e56ccddd3d992a_xs.jpg",
