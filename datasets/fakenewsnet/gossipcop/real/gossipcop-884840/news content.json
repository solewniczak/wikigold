Making me love both the South and Hollywood all at once.\n\n\n\nOk so first off I picked up this book due to it being filmed for PassionFlix. I had heard many people say wonderful things about Alessandra's books but I had never picked a book of hers up before. All I can say now is WOW!!!!\n\nThe way this book reads and goes along is so amazing. I'm from the south so I was able to identify with it very closely and by the end while I felt like Summer about wanting to get out...it made me love my small southern town.\n\n\n\nSummer Jenkins is a southern girl living in Georgia. She's from a small town where everyone knows your name and all your business. When their small town becomes the focal point for a new feature film staring the Hollywood heartthrob, Cole Masten, Summer sees it as her chance to escape the town she's lived in most her life. Little does she know that meeting Cole would soon have her staring in the film.\n\n\n\nCole Masten is the hottest actor in Hollywood and he's got the life he loves. A career he loves, fans who adore him and a wife he loves. Only he doesn't realize his wife no longer loves him. Walking in on something he wasn't supposed to know has his world turned upside down. Soon he finds himself in Quincy, Georgia focusing on his next film when he meets Summer Jenkins. Hearing her smart mouth with that sweet southern charm has him going insane. Will she be the one to truly undo him??\n\n\n\nThe chemistry between Summer and Cole can be felt from the moment they meet. Both have been scorned by love yet as much as they are trying to protect themselves they can't deny their attraction together. Seeing the small bits of concern Cole has for Summer while Summer lets her guard down briefly seeing the kinder side to Cole. They begin to get closer to one and other and from there all walls are down and feelings are known.\n\n\n\nI honestly am still reeling from this story and don't want to let them go. I want to know more...what will happen now?? Ohh my mind is racing with so many possibilities as to what will happen for them all.", "images": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/gno/sprites/nav-sprite-global-1x-hm-dsk-reorg._CB405937547_.png", "https://assoc-na.associates-amazon.com/abid/um?s=143-7941601-4493444&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/US-hq/2021/img/Amazon_Exports/XCM_CUTTLE_1351597_1786068_US_650x45_en_US._CB645630042_.jpg", "https://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:143-7941601-4493444:16BDMMBJKN3WT7MZRKZP$uedata=s:%2Frd%2Fuedata%3Fnoscript%26id%3D16BDMMBJKN3WT7MZRKZP:0", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ay19LlkpL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/dp/KU._CB463268225_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71sehu3i4xL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/45dd3295-5a00-4da5-8695-0f50434ce2ab._CR0,0,500,500_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61s0h47KsZL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71QF0i2qiWL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/amazonbookclub/ABC_logo_primary_beta._CB408510813_.svg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iS+84AGyL._CR0,559,961,961_UX175.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/app/QR-store-link-kindle-app._CB626291935_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31iWzEb4dXL._AC_SX60_CR,0,0,60,60_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61mCY8-wU3L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/transparent-pixel._V192234675_.gif", "https://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:143-7941601-4493444:16BDMMBJKN3WT7MZRKZP$uedata=s:%2Frd%2Fuedata%3Fstaticb%26id%3D16BDMMBJKN3WT7MZRKZP:0", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51LRIMl8wVL._AC_SX60_CR,0,0,60,60_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nlF7Ws+GL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/04388d9e-dccc-4d7f-a390-a724dd8f70c2._CR94,0,311,311_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Audible/Homestead/logo/audiblelogo._CB482869198_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61CuvQnTJkL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/amazonbookclub/chooseBooksImage._CB409113671_.svg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/amazonbookclub/joinClubsImage._CB409113671_.svg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/app/kindle-app-logo._CB668847749_.png", "https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ko2Qh4OWL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511IwTxSS+L._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Ld+adIjsL._CR0,46,867,867_UX175.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/personalization/ybh/loading-4x-gray._CB485916920_.gif", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511IwTxSS+L._AC_SX60_CR,0,0,60,60_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amzn-author-media-prod/e76o6tt4vscbah0fg4mqoj82tu._SY600_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars/db89ce67-280a-4695-8773-e1eefe94510a._CR87,0,225,225_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/amazonbookclub/scheduleWithEaseImage._CB409113670_.svg", "https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/d7d129ef-37f5-48d7-bc2a-ff79fd26eb9e._CR56,0,388,388_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/dd16de70-a458-4175-b49a-5277e72152a0._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Z7sU-JIPL._CR0,559,961,961_UX175.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amzn-author-media-prod/e76o6tt4vscbah0fg4mqoj82tu._SY600_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alessandra Torre", "Follow The Author", "Abqa"], "canonical_link": "https://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Dirt-Alessandra-Torre/dp/1940941717", "title": "Hollywood Dirt: Torre, Alessandra: 9781940941714: Amazon.com: Books", "meta_data": {"description": "Hollywood Dirt [Torre, Alessandra] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers.
