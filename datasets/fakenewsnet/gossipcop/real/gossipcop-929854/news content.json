On Wednesday, the actor commemorated the moment from the film \"Miss Congeniality\" when Miss Rhode Island described the perfect date in the film by saying in a new social media video, \"The perfect date, remember? Not too hot, not too cold -- just bring a light jacket.\"\n\nIn the film, Shatner plays pageant host Stan Fields in the 2000 film when he says, \"Miss Rhode Island, describe your perfect date,\" to which the contestant responds, \"That's a tough one. I'd have to say April 25th, because it's not too hot, not too cold. All you need is a light jacket.\" The line has gone down in history as one of the most iconic calendar dates in pop culture, along with \"It's October 3rd\" from \"Mean Girls.\"\n\nShatner was promoting a perfect date contest for site Match.com in a video he posted on Instagram about the scene: \"And to think it was 20 years ago that I asked the question,\" he said. The 87-year-old actor then asked his followers to tell him their perfect date.\n\nShatner appears to be very keyed into the modern dating scene. He is an avid fan of the \"Bachelor\" franchise and launched a social media campaign last year to get \"Bachelor\" Nick Viall kicked off of \"Dancing with the Stars\" because of Viall's behavior with Andi Dorfman in \"The Bachelorette.\"", "images": ["https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2018/04/25/f4aa2ee6-b651-4783-95e9-8bb3ff72adac/gettyimages-585200770.jpg", "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/04/25/f4aa2ee6-b651-4783-95e9-8bb3ff72adac/thumbnail/1200x630g2/1ab1a366cfa272f8b84a2ad77ec7c695/gettyimages-585200770.jpg", "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/03/10/b0abbedf-d869-4ee1-a948-38721fa07a96/thumbnail/140x90/8242f4b4df1d58dca58ba87882a5eaf9/will-smith-interview-1920.jpg", "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/14/1fc2913c-cb2d-49df-9a3c-de8c4c9fbc5a/thumbnail/80x80/4bf42ed2ccbfe1233a052870c6b4f366/cbsnews140andrea140x100.jpg", "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/02/25/e59c9b29-7d68-4f54-9dc9-d76ce5ddf4eb/thumbnail/140x90/ed84f3c886fb9236e5b7417c88e1e2a7/penn-zelezsky-instagram-copy.jpg", "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/02/24/d4d3e93a-3a8e-4b20-9be4-29df2e95e789/thumbnail/140x90/ba3c38559c165821bfa76cbf64c6e5f3/gettyimages-1211620384.jpg", "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/06/07/32d04fe2-fee4-48be-8c75-b98d5cbe91d0/thumbnail/140x90/f8ff3943d7e0d9a64725799ddae7ca9d/pete-davidson-interview-b-1920-495999-640x360.jpg", "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/02/27/9a01aaed-af31-4426-ad87-360100d4bf36/thumbnail/140x90g2/016807414738de2403762e25035f6806/untitled-design.png"], "top_img": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/04/25/f4aa2ee6-b651-4783-95e9-8bb3ff72adac/thumbnail/1200x630g2/1ab1a366cfa272f8b84a2ad77ec7c695/gettyimages-585200770.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrea Park", "Andrea Is An Entertainment Producer At Cbsnews.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/miss-congeniality-perfect-date-april-25-william-shatner/", "title": "William Shatner commemorates perfect date: April 25", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "color-scheme": "only light", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Shatner knows the perfect date after he asked the question in the film &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot;", "al": {"web": {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/miss-congeniality-perfect-date-april-25-william-shatner/"}, "ios": {"app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223, "url": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/miss-congeniality-perfect-date-april-25-william-shatner/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews", "url": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/miss-congeniality-perfect-date-april-25-william-shatner/"}}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/miss-congeniality-perfect-date-april-25-william-shatner/", "title": "William Shatner commemorates perfect date: April 25", "description": "Shatner knows the perfect date after he asked the question in the film \"Miss Congeniality\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/04/25/f4aa2ee6-b651-4783-95e9-8bb3ff72adac/thumbnail/1200x630g2/1ab1a366cfa272f8b84a2ad77ec7c695/gettyimages-585200770.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267, "pages": 131459315949}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSNewsEntertainment/", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"iphone": "CBS News", "ipad": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"iphone": 334256223, "ipad": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/miss-congeniality-perfect-date-april-25-william-shatner/", "ipad": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/miss-congeniality-perfect-date-april-25-william-shatner/", "googleplay": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/miss-congeniality-perfect-date-april-25-william-shatner/"}}, "site": "@CBSNews", "title": "William Shatner commemorates perfect date: April 25", "description": "Shatner knows the perfect date after he asked the question in the film \"Miss Congeniality\"", "image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/04/25/f4aa2ee6-b651-4783-95e9-8bb3ff72adac/thumbnail/1200x630g2/1ab1a366cfa272f8b84a2ad77ec7c695/gettyimages-585200770.jpg", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/andreapark", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "theme-color": "#101010", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "CBS News", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com", "summary": ""}
