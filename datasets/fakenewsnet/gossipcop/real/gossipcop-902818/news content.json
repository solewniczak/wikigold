If you over-condition your hair, each the cuticle will be heavily coated, making it impossible for other products, such as serums and oils, to penetrate and work effectively.\n\nOver-conditioning can occur in several ways:\n\nHow can I tell if I'm over-conditioning my hair?\n\nIf you have thick and dry hair, over-conditioning may seem impossible. However, product build-up is possible on any hair type. You'll notice your hair becoming unmanageable, soft, limp, or flat. Any sort of updo will be impossible, as your hair has no natural grip.\n\nOver-conditioning thin, fine hair weighs it down and makes it look oily and perhaps stringy. It's probably easier to see signs of over-conditioning on this hair type.\n\nMy hair is over-conditioned. What can I do?\n\nThe best way to tackle over-conditioned hair is to use a clarifying shampoo to remove any product build-up. Christophe Robin Clarifying Shampoo is perfect at reviving over-conditioned hair and making it more manageable.\n\nYou can also try a clarifying scrub such as Christophe Robin Cleansing Purifying Scrub. Exfoliating your scalp once a week will help prevent product build-up that blocks follicles and leads to itchiness and a greasy feeling.\n\nIf your hair has become soft and limp due to over-conditioning, consider a protein treatment. Proteins help to strengthen and stiffen each hair strand to add texture back into the hair. We recommend evo mane attention protein treatment 150ml.\n\nHow can I prevent over-conditioning?\n\nTo prevent over-conditioning, it's important to use the right amount of conditioner and rinse it out thoroughly. Building a clarifying shampoo or scalp scrub into your regular routine will also help to stop product build-up. Conditioning is a crucial step to achieving healthy, beautiful hair, regardless of your hair types. However, conditioning is also a step that has to be carefully monitored and managed for best results. If you see signs of over-conditioned hair, it's important to remove the gunk to retain gorgeous locks.", "images": ["https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/nuxtimages/backtotop.svg", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/270/873/ELEVEN_Australia_Keep_My_Colour_Blonde_Shampoo_300ml_%28ELE137%29_Hero.png?width=14&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/h/y/hydrate_me_wash_png.png?width=18&height=18", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/270/873/ELEVEN_Australia_Keep_My_Colour_Blonde_Shampoo_300ml_%28ELE137%29_Hero.png?width=18&height=18", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/274/069/ELEVEN_Australia_Deep_Clean_Shampoo_%28ELE142%29_Hero.png?width=18&height=18", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/nuxtimages/logo-2018-1.svg", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/263/784/ELEVEN_Australia_Hydrate_My_Hair_Moisture_Shampoo_300ml_%28ELE132%29_Hero.png?width=14&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/k/e/kerastase-resistance-bain-extentioniste-shampoo_500.png?width=14&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/274/069/ELEVEN_Australia_Deep_Clean_Shampoo_%28ELE142%29_Hero.png?width=14&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/a/n/angel_wash-01-testnew.jpg?width=18&height=18", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/263/784/ELEVEN_Australia_Hydrate_My_Hair_Moisture_Shampoo_300ml_%28ELE132%29_Hero.png?width=18&height=18", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/267/588/ELEVEN_Australia_I_Want_Body_Volume_Shampoo_-_300ml_%28ELE122%29_Hero.png?width=18&height=18", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/n/a/nap_rb_copy.png?width=14&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/391/079/eleven_repair_shampoo_1024.png?width=18&height=18", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/b/o/bohemian.png?width=14&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/391/079/eleven_repair_shampoo_1024.png?width=14&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/h/y/hydrate_me_wash_png.png?width=14&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/skin/frontend/enterprise/adore/images/product-loader.svg", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/nuxtimages/Adore-Society-Icon-Logo-Tagline-White.svg", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/364/133/Alpha-H_Liquid_Gold_100mL.png?width=18&height=18", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/t/h/the_ordinary_hyaluronic_acid_2_b5.png?width=14&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/images/Footer-Icons.jpg?width=5&height=5", "https://images.ctfassets.net/pi28xy1s107o/bigstock_woman_unhappy_with_the_conditi_54565763/1c9186aecef2c3d55737d2ff667208d0/bigstock-Woman-Unhappy-With-The-Conditi-54565763", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/a/n/angel_wash-01-testnew.jpg?width=14&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/t/h/the_ordinary_niacinamide_10_zinc_1_.png?width=14&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/k/e/kerastase-resistance-bain-extentioniste-shampoo_500.png?width=18&height=18", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/images/Footer-Icons.jpg?width=30&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/g/l/glycolic_scrub.png?width=14&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/267/588/ELEVEN_Australia_I_Want_Body_Volume_Shampoo_-_300ml_%28ELE122%29_Hero.png?width=14&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/g/l/glycolic_scrub.png?width=18&height=18", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/t/h/the_ordinary_niacinamide_10_zinc_1_.png?width=18&height=18", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/n/a/nap_rb_copy.png?width=18&height=18", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/364/133/Alpha-H_Liquid_Gold_100mL.png?width=14&height=14", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/b/o/bohemian.png?width=18&height=18", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/t/h/the_ordinary_hyaluronic_acid_2_b5.png?width=18&height=18"], "top_img": "https://images.ctfassets.net/pi28xy1s107o/bigstock_woman_unhappy_with_the_conditi_54565763/1c9186aecef2c3d55737d2ff667208d0/bigstock-Woman-Unhappy-With-The-Conditi-54565763", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/hair/conditioner/guide/over-conditioning", "title": "Is There Such a Thing as Over-Conditioning Hair?", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#201F26", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "facebook-domain-verification": "kw6tvly4ycvpdgeqoejdnnfii6lwfk", "description": "Over-conditioning hair is down to poor application and can cause product buildup.
