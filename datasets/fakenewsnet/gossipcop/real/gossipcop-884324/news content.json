All are safe and accounted for, but the tragedy has one band member questioning his past stances.\n\nThe shooting proved to be a transitional moment for Josh Abbott Band guitarist Caleb Keeter, a \u201cproponent of the Second Amendment\u201d his entire life. \u201cI cannot express how wrong I was,\u201d he posted to Twitter this morning. \u201cWe actually have members of our crew with CHL licenses, and legal firearms on the bus. They were useless. We couldn\u2019t touch them for fear police might think we were part of the massacre and shoot us\u2026enough is enough\u2026we need gun control RIGHT. NOW. My biggest regret is that I stubbornly didn\u2019t realize it until my brothers on the road and myself were threatened by it.\u201d\n\nFrontman Abbott released an official statement on the band\u2019s Facebook earlier today. \u201cEveryone in our band and crew are safe,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI had just left and was in the Mandalay Bay on the 20th floor with my fianc\u00e9e during the shooting just a few floors away. The band & crew were on the concert grounds and saw people get shot. Some of my crew members were hit with shrapnel, but not injured. We are deeply disturbed by this horrific act of violence and send our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families. It was a long awful night but we are blessed to be alive and healthy. Hug your loved ones tight.\u201d\n\nAbbott also chronicled some of the chaos from the night before, asking for prayers and eventually informing fans that he and the band were safe. Earlier this morning, he posted about how badly the event had shaken him, saying \u201cI\u2019ll never unhear those gunshots; and our band & crew will never forget how that moment made them feel.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll never unhear those gunshots; and our band & crew will never forget how that moment made them feel.
