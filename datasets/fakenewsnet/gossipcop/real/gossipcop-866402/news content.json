In the first image, the Vogue cover star wears a black trench coat slung around her shoulders paired with the brand\u2019s over-the-knee white, heeled Tiemodel boot and in the second wears a white button-down with the It-Girl-approved Cling ankle boot .\n\nBut there\u2019s something else striking about these images aside from the footwear\u2013Gigi\u2019s brand new beauty look! For the campaign, Weitzman decided to switch things up, putting their favorite model in a pixie cut wig by Shay Ashual. The faux style was meant to evoke Jean Seberg\u2019s character in the iconic French New Wave film Breathless, giving the images a 1960s feel as well as \u201ca chic and modern twist on her fourth consecutive Stuart Weitzman campaign.\u201d Now the only question is, will this photo shoot convince Gigi to finally take the plunge and make the cut for real? It could really help her and Zayn take their couple twinning to all new heights.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=792&h=396&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fgigi-hadid2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fgigi-hadid2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fgigi-hadid-1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=792&h=396&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fgigi-hadid2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Kirkpatrick", "July"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/gigi-hadid-pixie-cut-stuart-weitzman-campaign/", "title": "Gigi Hadid Has a Pixie Cut in Stuart Weitzman Campaign", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Gigi Hadid,Hair Changes,Models,Shoes", "news_keywords": "Gigi Hadid,Hair Changes,Models,Shoes", "description": "Gigi Hadid ditched her usual long, wavy locks, debuting a new pixie cut in the latest Stuart Weitzman campaign", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Gigi Hadid Sports a '60s-Inspired Pixie Cut in Her Fourth Stuart Weitzman Campaign", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/gigi-hadid-pixie-cut-stuart-weitzman-campaign/", "description": "Gigi Hadid ditched her usual long, wavy locks, debuting a new pixie cut in the latest Stuart Weitzman campaign", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=792&h=396&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fgigi-hadid2.jpg", "width": 792, "height": 396}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/style/gigi-hadid-pixie-cut-stuart-weitzman-campaign/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fgigi-hadid2.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/style/gigi-hadid-pixie-cut-stuart-weitzman-campaign/", "title": "Gigi Hadid Sports a '60s-Inspired Pixie Cut in Her Fourth Stuart Weitzman Campaign", "description": "Gigi Hadid ditched her usual long, wavy locks, debuting a new pixie cut in the latest Stuart Weitzman campaign", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=792&h=396&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fgigi-hadid2.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/style/gigi-hadid-pixie-cut-stuart-weitzman-campaign/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
