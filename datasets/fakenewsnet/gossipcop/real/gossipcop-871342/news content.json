Throughout their whirlwind romance, de Lesseps defended D\u2019Agostino against numerous cheating allegations, including being caught by a friend of costar Bethenny Frankel\u2019s kissing a mysterious blonde at The Regency Hotel the day before his engagement party.\n\nThe former couple was set up by fellow Housewife Dorinda Medley, who \u201cdecided to make a match\u201d when she noticed they were both single. Similar to her marriage to first husband Count Alexandre DeLesseps, to whom she was married 17 years and shares two children, de Lesseps thought that quickly falling for someone was \u201chow it worked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got engaged after three months and then we got married a year after, so I thought, plenty of time, because I got married two weeks after I met my first husband and it lasted 17 years, so I thought, you know, this is how it works,\u201d she explains.\n\nWATCH: Take a Look at Some of the Highlights of Luann de Lesseps & Tom D\u2019Agostino Jr.\u2019s Wedding\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s 50 years old, he never asked anyone to marry him, so I thought I was different. I know he loved me \u2014 that\u2019s not the issue and I know he went into it just like I did with a big heart and a lot of love. And then he just couldn\u2019t give up his bachelor kind of lifestyle. And that didn\u2019t work for me,\u201d she tells host Wendy Williams.\n\nOf \u201cthe last straw\u201d in their short-lived marriage, de Lesseps says it was a combination of things: \u201cjust between the women, the press, him going out, me getting phone calls, pictures of him at the same bars where he frequents all the time, which I asked him not to go to.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just kept happening and I got to a certain point where I got totally fed up. I couldn\u2019t do it anymore \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore,\u201d de Lesseps says. \u201cI was unhappy, and I think he was unhappy, too.\u201d\n\nSince their split, de Lesseps reveals that she saw D\u2019Agostino, 50, at a party: \u201cWe said hello. It\u2019s amicable.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Why Luann de Lesseps Won\u2019t Delete Tom D\u2019Agostino Pictures\n\nAlthough the pair has since gone their separate ways, de Lesseps cherishes the memories she shared with D\u2019Agostino.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t live with regrets. I mean, it was a part of my life that I was in love,\u201d she tells Williams of not choosing to erase photos of her and D\u2019Agostino that were previously shared on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s better to not have pain and suffering and be unhappy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a beautiful wedding. It was his birthday, it was gorgeous,\u201d she says of her Dec. 31 lavish nuptials with D\u2019Agostino. \u201cI don\u2019t take the pictures down. I\u2019m not that kind of person. I don\u2019t live in the past. It\u2019s a part of my life and that\u2019s how I live. I live adventurously, I live with love and I\u2019m not afraid to love either. I\u2019m not afraid to take chances and live my life.\u201d\n\nThe Wendy Williams Show airs weekdays (check your local listings).", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/cheryl-burke.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338.0952380952px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/america-ferrera.jpg?crop=0px%2C91px%2C2000px%2C1339px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/frankie-muniz-1-20001.jpg?crop=541px%2C264px%2C951px%2C636px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/nick-lachey-son-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338.0952380952px&resize=420%2C281", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/bob-weinstein1.jpg?crop=211px%2C0px%2C1518px%2C1016px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kardashians.jpg?crop=0px%2C490px%2C2000px%2C1338px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/kendall-kylie-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1333px%2C891.84047619048px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/audrina-patridge-r-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1975px%2C1321.369047619px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/luann-tom-dagostino.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/roseanne1.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/blac-chyna1.jpg?crop=4px%2C0px%2C1992px%2C1332.7428571429px&resize=420%2C281"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/luann-tom-dagostino.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452/http://people.com/tv/luann-de-lesseps-tom-dagostino-relationship-amicable/", "title": "Luann de Lesseps Says Relationship with Ex Tom D'Agostino Is Amicable", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1143086910", "description": "\"I have been defending Tom for the past two years and I feel like Wonder Woman,\" Luann de Lesseps said on The Wendy Williams Show of defending ex-husband Tom D'Agostino against past cheating allegations", "keywords": "luann de lesseps, tom d'agostino, countess luann, rhony, luann rhony, luann divorc", "news_keywords": "luann de lesseps, tom d'agostino, countess luann, rhony, luann rhony, luann divorc", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Luann de Lesseps Says Saw Ex-Husband Tom D'Agostino at a Party: Our Relationship Is 'Amicable'", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452/http://people.com/tv/luann-de-lesseps-tom-dagostino-relationship-amicable/", "description": "\u201cI have been defending Tom for the past two years, and I feel like Wonder Woman,\u201d Luann de Lesseps said on The Wendy Williams Show", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015452im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/luann-tom-dagostino.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-17T21:43:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-17T22:03:42+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@people", "creator": "@people"}, "application-name": "PEOPLE.com", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://people.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/a39c9d87d3ee529a684f7a5b3b557adc?s=16"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508276597.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
