The mom-to-be was photographed driving into the luncheon wearing a black top with a high neckline, while her husband sported a suit as he took the drivers\u2019 seat.\n\nAlso heading to the party were Meghan\u2019s in-laws, Prince William and Kate Middleton.

Despite previous reports that Prince William and Kate would likely be spending the holiday with the Middleton family in Bucklebury, the couple will be joining the rest of the royals, including Harry and Meghan, in Norfolk for Christmas with the Queen at Sandringham.\n\nClaims have swirled about tension between brothers William and Harry and their wives, Kate and Meghan. A source tells PEOPLE that last year, the couples enjoyed a memorable first Christmas together, when Meghan made her debut walk to church with the royal family on Christmas Day.\n\n775093241PS00076_Members_Of Kate Middleton, Prince William, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at Christmas 2017 | Credit: Chris Jackson/Getty", "images":
