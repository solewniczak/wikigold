The group happily fawned over the 6-year-old.\n\nPink, Willow Sage Hart Pink (right) and daughter Willow Sage Hart | Credit: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP\n\nLBT also wrapped their arms around Angie Gentry, widow of Troy Gentry, and 15-year-old daughter Kaylee after Dierks Bentley, Rascal Flatts and Eddie Montgomery performed the Montgomery Gentry hit \u201cMy Town\u201d in Troy\u2019s honor. When Montgomery walked backstage, he was stopped several times for pats on the back.\n\nWaiting on a B stage to begin his song \u201cAsk Me How I Know,\u201d Garth Brooks good-naturedly waved his arms and conducted the crowd as they sang along to wife Trisha Yearwood\u2019s 1990 hit \u201cShe\u2019s in Love with the Boy,\u201d which was playing on the loudspeakers during the break. Kelley, a Solo cup in hand, chatted with Yearwood as Brooks performed, and at one point the Lady A singer swayed her back and forth to the music.\n\nKelley was far from the only artist who took advantage of the backstage bar: Lambert returned during a commercial break sipping on a glass as she talked intently to pal Bentley and Thomas Rhett weaved his way through the crowd with a drink in each hand \u2014 until his record label president Scott Borchetta swiped a sip from one of his cups.\n\nWhile wife Carrie Underwood kept the show running with co-host Brad Paisley, Mike Fisher seemed to enjoy the chance to sit in the audience at his first CMA Awards since retiring from the NHL earlier this year. The hockey star shook hands with several stars and sung along to Jon Pardi\u2019s \u201cDirt on My Boots\u201d.\n\nUnderwood\u2019s performance of the traditional hymn \u201cSoftly and Tenderly\u201d honoring those that died both in the country industry and in the Las Vegas shooting tragedy was one of the night\u2019s most poignant moments. The singer wiped away tears after finishing her song, and then a team of helpers escorted her and her dramatic dress backstage.\n\ncarrie-underwood-memoriam-2 Carrie Underwood | Credit: Rick Diamond/Getty\n\nMinutes before the night\u2019s final award was announced, Brooks was canoodling with his wife in the front row, giving her a cuddle and a kiss after taking a selfie together. When his name was announced as Entertainer of the Year, he declared \u201cWe are a family.\u201d And then, making it clear that he does play favorites in one special case, he added, \u201cMs. Yearwood, I am yours forever,\u201d before heading backstage to be greeted with high fives and big hugs from his country brothers and sisters.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F10%2Ffaith-hill1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fpink1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fcarrie-underwood-memoriam-1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fcarrie-underwood-memoriam-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fcarrie-underwood-memoriam-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eileen Finan", "November"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/country/cma-awards-2017-what-you-didnt-see/", "title": "CMA Awards 2017: What You Didn't See on TV", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Chris Stapleton,CMA Awards,Darius Rucker,Eric Church,Faith Hill,Garth Brooks,Hillary Scott,Luke Bryan,Miranda Lambert,News,Tim McGraw,Trisha Yearwood", "news_keywords": "Chris Stapleton,CMA Awards,Darius Rucker,Eric Church,Faith Hill,Garth Brooks,Hillary Scott,Luke Bryan,Miranda Lambert,News,Tim McGraw,Trisha Yearwood", "description": "PEOPLE goes behind the scenes at the 2017 CMA Awards to share all those moments the cameras didn't catch", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "CMA Awards 2017: What You Didn't See on TV", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/country/cma-awards-2017-what-you-didnt-see/", "description": "PEOPLE goes behind the scenes at the 2017 CMA Awards to share all those moments the cameras didn't catch", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fcarrie-underwood-memoriam-1.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/country/cma-awards-2017-what-you-didnt-see/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fcarrie-underwood-memoriam-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/country/cma-awards-2017-what-you-didnt-see/", "title": "CMA Awards 2017: What You Didn't See on TV", "description": "PEOPLE goes behind the scenes at the 2017 CMA Awards to share all those moments the cameras didn't catch", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fcarrie-underwood-memoriam-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/country/cma-awards-2017-what-you-didnt-see/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
