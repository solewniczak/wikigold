Whatever you call it, highlighting has become a routine staple in basically everyone\u2019s makeup routine. The bright, shiny sister to contouring, highlighting is the act of applying a light-reflecting color on the planes of your face, such as the tops of your cheekbones, your brow bone, and the bridge of your nose, in order to create the illusion of brightness.\n\nWhile several high-end brands have cult-favorite, highlighting products in their line-up, their prices aren\u2019t so wallet-friendly.\n\nrihanna1.gif Credit: Giphy\n\nThankfully, there\u2019s a slew of drugstore products that can keep you looking radiant without going broke \u2014 but not all drugstore highlighters are created equal. Some are way too glittery, while others just end up being weirdly chalky. Whether you\u2019re someone who only highlights their face on special occasion or you want a cheekbone strobed so brightly you can see it from space, these are the six budget-friendly highlighters that will give a glow even Jennifer Lopez is jealous of.\n\nRevlon Photoready Skinlights Face Illuminator, $9.99\n\nrevlon.jpg Credit: Revlon\n\nThis particular highlighter was a cult favorite over a decade ago, originally known as simply SkinLights, but Revlon took it off the market, breaking several hearts in the process. They brought it back in 2014 due to customer demand, giving it a new name and reformulating it so it has better texture and consistency than the older version. It\u2019s a liquid formula and comes in four shades that you can mix and match together, wear alone, or combine with your foundation for an all-over strobed effect. The liquid formula also makes it easy to mix in with your body lotion to create a glow on your collarbone, shoulders, and legs.\n\nPhysicians Formula Nude Wear Touch of Glow Palette, $14.95\n\nnudeglow.jpg Credit: Physicians Formula\n\nSome people swear by PF\u2019s Mineral Glow Pearls Powder Palette, a small circular compact with bronze-y \u201cpearls\u201d of color. That one\u2019s great, but we find that it works more like a bronzer, adding warmth more than a glow. The Touch of Glow Palette is a small square compact with four shades of shimmering powder: champagne, pink, light gold, and a soft bronze. You can definitely use them separately, but this product really packs a punch when you swirl all the colors together for a customized glow.\n\nMaybelline Face Studio Master Strobe Stick, $7.99\n\nmaybelline.jpg Credit: Maybelline\n\nHonestly, is there anything easier to use than makeup in stick form? Maybelline\u2019s Strobe Stick is basically a crayon for your face. It\u2019s small and only comes in two shades (\u201cLight Iridescent\u201d and \u201cMedium Nude Glow\u201d) but it packs a major punch \u2014 a little goes a long way, and you can easily apply a small application and buff it out along more areas of your face with your fingers or a brush. This is a great dupe for NARS\u2019 the Multiple Stick, in terms of formula (not necessarily color). The creamy formula works well with skin\u2019s natural texture, and dries down to a pearlescent glow with a slightly powdery finish. For 10 bucks, you can\u2019t go wrong. Plus, it\u2019s SO easy to travel with.\n\nBlack Radiance Artisan Color Baked Bronzer, $4.99\n\nblackradiancebronzer.jpg Credit: Black Radiance\n\nThis is technically a bronzer, but as we said above, highlighting is a technique, so you can use whatever gives you the best look for what you\u2019re going for. It can be tough to find a decent highlighter for darker shades of skin, but this comes in four shades (Gingersnap, Rum Spice, Caramel, and Blackberry, shown above) that will help you achieve a diamond glow. The powder formula is marbleized, mixing together several shades of tones of caramel, gold, brown, and gold for a unique finish. You can also use it wet (we recommend using a makeup setting spray over water for extra staying power), which turns it into a sheer cream-like formula. Be forewarned though: The shimmer factor in this is strong, so it\u2019s not for the weak of heart or for those afraid of a little extra dazzle.\n\nNYX Born to Glow Illuminator, $7.50\n\nborntoglow.jpg Credit: NYX\n\nThis might easily be one of the most recognizable drugstore highlighters, aside from the aforementioned wet N wild one. NYX\u2019s Born to Glow Liquid Illuminator is basically an IRL Snapchat filter for your skin. It\u2019s easy to find at basically any drugstore and can be used as under or over foundation and/or mixed in with your foundation. Don\u2019t let the name fool you though, as it\u2019s less of a liquid and more of a lightweight cream. It comes in a squeeze tube and is available in four shades: Sunbeam (pale pink pearl), Gleam (golden peach pearl, shown above), Pure Gold (gold pearl), and Sun Goddess (bronze pearl). They can also be mixed together to create your own shade. It also has unimaginable staying power, so if you have oily skin or have issue with your product tending to run, this one\u2019s for you.\n\nwet n wild MegaGlo Highlighting Powder,
