Fans traveled from all over California to be present for the event.\n\nOne such fan got the chance to poke her head through Kimmel\u2019s sneak-peek hole, only to find Avengers actors Chadwick Boseman, Chris Hemsworth, Josh Brolin, Karen Gillan, and Sebastian Stan in the room beyond. Thor himself helped her poke through as she laughed nervously. \u201cYou guys are awesome,\u201d she said, \u201cLiterally at a loss for words right now.\u201d\n\nLuckily, the Avengers gave her something to chew on: two tickets to Infinity War in IMAX, which they stuck between Danielle\u2019s teeth before sending her on her way.\n\nAnother fan admitted he skipped preaching at his church for the Marvel event. His dedication to the superheroes was rewarded with a sneak peek at the real-live Avengers; Boseman jokingly laid his hand on the fan\u2019s head, laughing, \u201cFather forgive you!\u201d\n\n\u201cY\u2019all should see the effect you guys have on people,\u201d he told the actors. \u201cYou guys are great.\u201d Once again, his fandom was rewarded, and another two Infinity War tickets were put in his mouth.\n\nCheck out the sneak peek clip above.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Favengers-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Favengers-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mary Kate Carr", "April", "At Am Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/26/avengers-surprise-fans-on-kimmel/", "title": "Avengers: Infinity War cast surprises fans on Jimmy Kimmel Live", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Chadwick Boseman,Chris Hemsworth,Jimmy Kimmel,Josh Brolin,Karen Gillan,Last Night on Late Night,Sebastian Stan", "news_keywords": "Chadwick Boseman,Chris Hemsworth,Jimmy Kimmel,Josh Brolin,Karen Gillan,Last Night on Late Night,Sebastian Stan", "description": "Some lucky fans got a sneak peak at the Avengers - literally - thanks to Jimmy Kimmel", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Watch the 'Avengers: Infinity War' cast surprise fans on 'Kimmel'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/26/avengers-surprise-fans-on-kimmel/", "description": "Some lucky fans got a sneak peak at the Avengers - literally - thanks to Jimmy Kimmel", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Favengers-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/26/avengers-surprise-fans-on-kimmel/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Favengers-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/26/avengers-surprise-fans-on-kimmel/", "title": "Watch the 'Avengers: Infinity War' cast surprise fans on 'Kimmel'", "description": "Some lucky fans got a sneak peak at the Avengers - literally - thanks to Jimmy Kimmel", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Favengers-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/26/avengers-surprise-fans-on-kimmel/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/l919rsqOU3I"], "publish_date": 1524693600.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
