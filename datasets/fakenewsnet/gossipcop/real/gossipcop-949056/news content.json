News in May. The rapper spoke highly of the \u201cBad at Love\u201d singer in March at the iHeartRadio Music Awards, telling reporters that, \u201cWe\u2019re coworkers, you know? We both do this at a pretty high level, and it\u2019s really dope to get to share that kind of experience with the person you\u2019re actually dating.\u201d\n\nFans of the couple began whispering about a possible split earlier this week, when Halsey tweeted lyrics from her song \u201cColors\u201d on Monday \u2014 then provided further explanation when questioned.\n\n\u201cYou were a vision in the morning when the light came through. I know I\u2019ve only felt religion when I\u2019ve laid with you,\u201d she quoted, then clarified, \u201cIt\u2019s really peculiar and beautiful when a song takes on a new meaning. When it feels like it\u2019s about a different person, or when a lyric about something nice turns mean, or vice verse. The songs evolve as we/I do. How amazing.\u201d\n\nSpotify's Inaugural Secret Genius Awards hosted by Lizzo Halsey and G-Eazy | Credit: Christopher Polk/Getty\n\nV 109 Launch Party, Gramercy Park Hotel, New York, USA - 13 Sep 2017 Halsey and G-Eazy | Credit: Sansho Scott/BFA/Shutterstock\n\nEagle-eyed followers soon noticed photos of the couple disappearing from Halsey\u2019s Instagram account, followed by a new post Tuesday afternoon captioned, \u201cKiss my dog on the forehead and then kiss ur ass goodbye. \u2705\u201d\n\nThe quote is a play on lyrics from Drake\u2019s new song \u201c8 Out of 10,\u201d on which he rapped, \u201cKiss my son on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fhalsey_statement-1.jpeg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fgettyimages-976814074-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fhalsey.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1684&h=842&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fgettyimages-976814074-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fhalsey.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1684&h=842&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fgettyimages-976814074-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Michaud", "July"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/halsey-g-eazy-split-taking-time-apart/", "title": "Halsey and G-Eazy Split: Musicians 'Taking Time Apart' After Year of Dating", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Breakups,G-Eazy,Halsey,News", "news_keywords": "Breakups,G-Eazy,Halsey,News", "description": "\"I wish him the best.
