I\u2019ve had an outpouring of lovely messages and care packages from the production team and the producers,\u201d Ali said. \u201cAnd Padma has been wonderful. We\u2019ve caught up over lunch, and she has come to sit with me during my chemo treatments to keep me company. I\u2019m pretty thankful for my Top Chef fam.\u201d\n\nAli said she found out about her cancer after she began experiencing pain while working at a pop-up restaurant at the US Open last fall.\n\n\u201cI brushed it off as a pulled muscle from cooking,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I woke up one morning toward the end of the event, with excruciating pain in a very swollen shoulder and went straight to the emergency room.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Ali said, she underwent a series of tests and biopsies that resulted in a diagnosis three weeks later.", "images":
