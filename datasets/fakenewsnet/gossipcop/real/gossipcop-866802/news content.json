The conversation came to a head last week when two young girls were told they would not be able to board a United Airlines flight because they were wearing leggings. And the issue of whether or not to wear sneakers, though not likely to set off a viral news story, still tends to polarize. Leave it to frequent flyer Miranda Kerr, though, to override the debate with a look that combined the comfort of a legging and the elegance of a heel in one fell swoop.\n\nKerr touched down at Los Angeles International airport today in a tonal look that started from the ground up. She wore stirrup spandex boots by Balenciaga, a legging-like silhouette that extends from hip to toe for a smooth, seamless finish. The effect was a stylish step up from the stretchy sportswear that we\u2019re used to seeing at the airport\u2014and everywhere else, for that matter.\n\nKerr tucked a slim navy top into an Ala\u00efa miniskirt in the same shade. While a pencil skirt would have been impractical for travel, her fit-and-flare silhouette offered a more movement-friendly alternative that felt just as feminine. Plus, the laser-cut detail on the hem tied in with the floral embroidery covering the Samantha Thavasa shoulder bag swinging at her side. Kerr threw on a tailored overcoat in for good measure, because you never know when those cabin temperatures might take a dip.", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58e5584eff99221338002e0e/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/holding-miranda-kerr-celebrity-style.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.02dcb2fef16d86c695ce8d290a3fd13c7f6c3182.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.00b68c0d9934396a2a234f4f43427e3affd58e9b.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58e55859a315d21111f7baf1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/social-miranda-kerr-celebrity-style.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.f2c4cf0289092a5686b7c6db87806b427e705af9.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58e55859a315d21111f7baf1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/social-miranda-kerr-celebrity-style.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Maria Ward"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/miranda-kerr-airport-leggings-debate-celebrity-style", "title": "Miranda Kerr Has a Stylish Answer to the Airport Leggings Debate", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Miranda Kerr\u2019s travel outfit was a stylish step up from the in-flight leggings-and-sneakers look.", "id": "58e5588fff99221338002e0f", "keywords": "miranda kerr", "news_keywords": "miranda kerr", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "58e5588fff99221338002e0f", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Miranda Kerr\u2019s travel outfit was a stylish step up from the in-flight leggings-and-sneakers look.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58e558478c31b97f797d8e41/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/square-miranda-kerr-celebrity-style.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58e558478c31b97f797d8e41/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/square-miranda-kerr-celebrity-style.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Miranda Kerr\u2019s travel outfit was a stylish step up from the in-flight leggings-and-sneakers look.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58e55859a315d21111f7baf1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/social-miranda-kerr-celebrity-style.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Miranda Kerr Has a Stylish Answer to the Airport Leggings Debate", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/miranda-kerr-airport-leggings-debate-celebrity-style"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-04-05T22:16:31.865Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58e55859a315d21111f7baf1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/social-miranda-kerr-celebrity-style.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491430591.865, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
