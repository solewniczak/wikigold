If you'd like to appear on Highsnobiety, contact: advertising@highsnobiety.com.\n\nIf you managed to get through the whole of lockdown without a Nintendo Switch then well done. Why not treat yourself to a Nintendo Switch OLED? The portable games console made such an impact during lockdown because of its ease. No need to find a spot for it on your cluttered tv stand and light enough to bring it with you when you move from your bed to your sofa, it\u2019s a home-entertainment dream come true, really. Better still, the new and improved Nintendo Switch OLED will be released on October 8, and you can guarantee your console through StockX.\n\nAs Highsnobiety readers know better than anyone, with great popularity comes exclusivity. Much like a limited-edition sneaker drop, the desire for the Nintendo Switch far outweighed the supply last year when international lockdowns began, leaving many wanting. Don\u2019t let it happen again. Be sure to bag your console at StockX before the release.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED lands with new additions on screen and with improved functionality. As the name suggests, the central upgrade comes in the form of a new 7-inch OLED screen which offers enhanced visuals. More vibrant colors and richer contrast makes the Nintendo Switch OLED a solid screen for media, too. Aside from the screen, a new LAN port increases the speed of online play while a new kickstand improves handsfree use so you can make the most of improved front-facing speakers. Combine that with 64GB of storage \u2014 double that of the original Switch model.\n\nHow much does the Nintendo Switch OLED cost?\n\nThe Nintendo Switch OLED retails for a price of $350, but if you\u2019re looking to guarantee a console in your hands, you may have to pay a premium. StockX market data indicates an all-time trade range between $388 and $474, with an average sale price of $431.\n\nShop the Nintendo Switch OLED below.\n\nWant to keep browsing?
