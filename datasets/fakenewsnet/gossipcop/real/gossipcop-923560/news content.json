In February, they returned from the royal tour of Norway and Sweden and continued making public appearances through late March. On March 22, Kate attended her final engagement with William by her side in London. Throughout her pregnancy, she has been spotted wearing blue maternity looks, prompting many to speculate that she might be having a baby boy.\n\nWilliam and Kate announced they were expecting their third child in September.\n\nFor more from the royals, watch the clip below!\n\nPregnant Kate Middleton and Prince William Attend Easter Services With Queen Elizabeth This video is unavailable because
