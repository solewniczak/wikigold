Maren Morris, Kelsea Ballerini and Carly Pearce each topped the country charts this year \u2014 and celebrated with an epic girls\u2019 night.\n\nThe three stars got together at Ballerini\u2019s home on Monday evening and each posted an adorable picture from the gathering \u2014 which, according to their captions, involved a lot of vino and tequila.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cShared some laughs + some horror stories + a LOT of tequila and wine,\u201d Morris, 28, wrote on Instagram before comparing the trio to their predecessors, Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt. \u201cMerry christmas from dolly, emmylou and linda,\u201d she added alongside the Christmas tree and wine emojis.\n\nPearce, 28, captioned her own photo: \u201cFound out last night that laughing, crying, tequila & wine DO mix \u2013 let\u2019s just be a trio \u2026 Merry Christmas y\u2019all #stillhungover.\u201d Ballerini, 25, also shared the photo with some queen and red heart emojis.\n\nWith the dearth of women played on country radio an ongoing issue, the women are supportive of each other\u2019s success. When Ballerini recently posted an emotional video of her mom finding out she\u2019d been nominated for a second Grammy, Morris and Pearce were quick to chime in.\n\n\u201cOk, was not emotionally prepared for this,\u201d Morris commented. \u201cSo happy for you, Kels. Let\u2019s do it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Pearce added next to the sobbing emoji.\n\nkelsea_ballerini Credit: Kelsea Ballerini Instagram\n\nAnd when Morris, who racked up five Grammy nominations last week, recently tweeted some quotes from critics \u2014 \u201cplenty said \u2018you\u2019re too country.\u2019 plenty said \u2018you ain\u2019t country enough.\u2019 guess what? both were wrong,\u201d she wrote \u2014 Ballerini was quick to amplify the sentiment.\n\nkelsea-ballerini-4 Kelsea Ballerini tweets support of Maren Morris | Credit: Maren Morris/Twitter\n\n\u201cAmen,\u201d she tweeted, to which Morris responded with, \u201cLet\u2019s do it our way.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t exactly a new friendship, either.

In one shot, they\u2019re posing selfie style, and Ballerini captioned it, \u201c3 country singers walk into an @erinoprea workout\u2026\u201d In the other, they\u2019re showing off their muscles and dumbbells \u2014 or, as Pearce described it, \u201cLots of country booty kickin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey told me you have to set boundaries of the time you spend apart,\u201d the \u201cCloser to You\u201d singer, who has been dating fellow singer Michael Ray since earlier this year, previously told PEOPLE. To Pearce and Ray, that has meant adding even more travel to their schedules.\n\n\u201cWe are always apart, but it\u2019s oddly the number one priority for both of us to be together,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s very good about showing up at shows for me or I fly to him. I used to be such a homebody, and I missed my home on the road a lot. But now home is where he is.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Carly Pearce on Her First Time Walking the Red Carpet with Anyone Else", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fkelsea-ballerini-2-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fkelsea-ballerini-4-1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1600&h=800&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2FMaren-Morris_1-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fkelsea-ballerini-1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fkelsea_ballerini-1.png"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1600&h=800&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2FMaren-Morris_1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maura Hohman", "December"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/country/maren-morris-kelsea-ballerini-carly-pearce-country-girls-night/", "title": "Hide the Wine!
