Morrison dropped out of NYU to begin appearing in the show.[7]\n\nIn 2001, Morrison was recruited to complete the quartet for the band LMNT. Morrison was replaced instead by Jonas Persch by the time its first album was released. Morrison commented in an interview about his experience in the boy band by remarking, \"It was the worst year of my life. You know when you're a performer and you're out there on stage and you're embarrassed that you're doing something wrong. It was pretty bad.\"[8]\n\nMorrison briefly appeared in a revival of The Rocky Horror Show in 2002.
