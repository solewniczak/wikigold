Between tears, McKinnon told the crowd, \"I'm really crying. I'm not making it up.\"\n\n\"Thank you to Lorne Michaels for giving me the job of my life. Thank you to my amazing colleagues, the cast and writers. It's really hard making 90 minutes of sketch comedy every week for 42 years,\" she said, before joking, \"Thank you, Ellen DeGeneres. Thank you, Hillary Clinton.\"\n\n\n\nWATCH: Amy Schumer Shares Hilarious Video of the Moment She Learned of Emmy Nominations\n\nThis is McKinnon's third year in a row being nominated in the category and first win. Though the Ghostbusters actress was clearly verklempt -- \"I'm shaking, guys!\" she admitted, as she held her award -- she ended with a touching dedication.\n\n\"On a personal note, thank you to my mother and sister and father,\" McKinnon said of her late father. \"He made me start watching SNL when I was 12. Thank you, and I miss you, pop.\"\n\nFollowing McKinnon's win, both Clinton and DeGeneres took to Twitter to congratulate her, as did SNL head writer and frequent collaborator, Chris Kelly, and co-stars Aidy Bryant and Leslie Jones. For her part, Jones tweeted, \"IM SCREAMING CRYING MY BITCH MY BITCH SHE WON YALL!!\"\n\nCongratulations on your Emmy, Kate! Big fan of yours, too. pic.twitter.com/w00QO1GwyH \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 19, 2016\n\nI swear I lost my shit!!
