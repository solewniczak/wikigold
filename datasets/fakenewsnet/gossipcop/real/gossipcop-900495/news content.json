At the end of the experiment, each couple will decide if they want to remain married or file for divorce.\n\nMolly Duff and Jonathan Francetic\n\nF:PHOTOMediaFactory ActionsRequests DropBox48458#MAFSERM_2643.jpg Credit: Courtney Hizey Photography & Emily Maultsby\n\nDuff is a commercial insurance adjuster from the suburbs of Boston. The 25-year-old has always looked to her parent\u2019s marriage as a great example of love and devotion. When her father passed away six years ago, she grew closer than ever to her mother and two sisters. Duff has been in several long-term relationships over the past few years, but she has yet to find \u201cthe one.\u201d She\u2019s looking for a man who is funny, hard-working and loyal.\n\nAn Army veteran and financial associate, Francetic grew up in Florida with his parents but now lives in the suburbs of Boston. Though his parents divorced when he was a teenager, the 28-year-old learned how to be independent from his mother, who also instilled in him the importance of compromise and unconditional love in a marriage. While many of his close family and friends view him as a pragmatic soldier, Francetic admits to having a romantic and sensitive side. His perfect match is a woman who is energetic and driven with a sense of humor and passion for adventure.\n\nShawniece Jackson and Jephte Pierre\n\nF:PHOTOMediaFactory ActionsRequests DropBox48458#mafsCHP_7944.jpg Credit: Courtney Hizey Photography & Emily Maultsby\n\nJackson, a 29-year-old entrepreneur and cosmetologist, is the eldest of 10 brothers and sisters and loves having a big family. Although her parents never married, Jackson witnessed what a healthy relationship looks like through her mother\u2019s marriage to her stepfather. Laziness is an absolute deal-breaker for Jackson, who values hard work and determination. She wants to be with a man who can keep up with her fun and energetic personality, make her laugh and keep her grounded.\n\nAs the eldest of fourteen children, Pierre is a natural leader and took on the role of a father figure to his younger siblings growing up. Although his parents are still together, he doesn\u2019t exactly admire their marriage and looks to others for relationship inspiration and advice. The 26-year-old second grade school teacher lives in Boston and has found dating extremely difficult. He\u2019s looking for an outgoing, mature and confident woman and is not interested in anyone with baggage from a past relationship. Like Jackson, Pierre finds laziness to be a big turn off.\n\nJaclyn Schwartzberg and Ryan Buckley\n\nF:PHOTOMediaFactory ActionsRequests DropBox48458#mafsCHP_6934.jpg Credit: Courtney Hizey Photography & Emily Maultsby\n\nSchwartzberg is a 29-year-old teacher turned sales representative living in the suburbs of Boston. She grew up with two siblings and parents whose relationship she describes as \u201cperfect.\u201d After the devastating and sudden loss of her boyfriend \u2014 who she believed to be her soulmate \u2014 almost two years ago, Schwartzberg hopes to find another man whom she can connect with on the same level. At this point, none of the men she has dated since have been able to compare. She is looking for someone who is funny, passionate and ready to commit.\n\nGrowing up, Buckley was surrounded by a loving family and calls his childhood with his three sisters and parents the quintessential American dream. The 29-year-old\u2019s parents are still very much in love, and he has the upmost respect and admiration for their marriage. Buckley loves serving his community as a firefighter in the Boston area and enjoys cooking for his buddies at the station. Although most of what he hoped for in life has been achieved, Ryan is missing that special someone to spend it with and admits that it\u2019s because, in part, he can be picky at times. He\u2019s looking for a woman who is energetic, thoughtful and sincere.\n\nFor more on Married at First Sight, pick up this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE, on stands Friday\n\ncover\n\nThis season, Dr.
