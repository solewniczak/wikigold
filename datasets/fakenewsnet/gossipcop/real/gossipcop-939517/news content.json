I lost my show, my show was canceled. And I was having difficult relationships with my BFFs, my day ones. And it was everyone\u2019s fault but my own.\u201d\n\nAfter she \u201cliterally found myself under my bed with my dog,\u201d the actress started working with trainer, life coach and actress A.J.

feud between the two in an April interview with Extra in which she promoted her new Facebook Watch talk show Red Table Talk.\n\n\u201cI have a really touching episode with Gabrielle Union,\u201d Pinkett Smith said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been on the best of terms for 17 years and we have a reconciliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know how it started!\u201d she said, adding their feud
