News.\n\n\"Thankfully all is fine and Brayden is doing great,\" a source told E! News. \"He's his happy, healthy self and Christina was being overly cautious by taking him to the hospital to be checked out.\"\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.

It's a beach entry if he fell in it's only a foot high, he would be ok 2. It's not his first time in or around the pool, but thanks for your \"concern\" aka judgment 3. AND most importantly I am right there and could be to him in 3 seconds SMH at this .....!!!!\"\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.
