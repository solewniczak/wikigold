But on the reunion, Luann showed a more vulnerable side \u2014 admitting that it alarms her to hear the constant rumors and see his \u201chot mic\u201d moments on the show (including one scene in which he referred to his married self as a \u201cdog with a collar\u201d and another in which he removed his mic while talking to an ex at a party).\n\nLuann-Tom-DAgostino Tom and Luann D\u2019Agostino | Credit: Robin Marchant/Getty\n\n\u201cBelieve me, I wasn\u2019t happy,\u201d Luann said. \u201cWhy do you think I stayed at the hotel last night, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI admit his humor is a little off,\u201d Luann continued, indicating that she understood how Tom \u2014 who was a lifelong bachelor before they wed \u2014 came off on the show. \u201cI always look like the tough guy but I try to look at it like, \u2018He\u2019s trying to be funny and he doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s going to look weird.\u2019 I\u2019m going to talk to him about how that might come off and how it made me feel. He shouldn\u2019t say things like that obviously.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s been more than just what he\u2019s been caught saying.\n\nrhony-reunion-1 Tinsley Mortimer, Carole Radziwill, Bethenny Frankel, Ramona Singer, Dorinda Medley, Luann D\u2019Agostino, Sonja Morgan | Credit: Charles Sykes/Bravo\n\nRamona Singer explained she heard Tom had met a divorced woman from Philadelphia at the bar of New York City\u2019s Regency Hotel and had gone up with her to her room, allegedly telling her he was in an open relationship with Luann.\n\nLuann forgave her then-fianc\u00e9 for the infidelity, telling PEOPLE at the time she wasn\u2019t going to let \u201ca stupid little kiss ruin the rest of [her] life.\u201d But even after Tom was caught, he still saw his unnamed makeout partner \u2014 having lunch with her in Los Angeles where Singer alleged they kissed again.\n\n\u201cIt was in the press,\u201d Singer claimed, ignoring Luann\u2019s defense that the woman\u2019s boyfriend was at the lunch too. \u201cYou denied it, but her quotes were in the press. And [Tom] laughed and said \u2018[Luann] deserved it.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI heard the same thing. That he was annoyed that you were selling things to the press about your wedding,\u201d confirmed Frankel. \u201cWhy would he be going out in N.Y. with the same girl he was making out with another time in L.A. weeks later? That\u2019s out of control.\u201d\n\nrhony-reunion-3 The Real Housewives of New York City season 9 reunion\n\nSo why didn\u2019t the Housewives bring these things up to Luann earlier? According to Frankel, there was no need.\n\n\u201cIt feels to all of us that you have your own particular dynamic,\u201d the Skinnygirl mogul said. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for the group \u2014 but I\u2019ve spoken to several of you \u2014 but I think we are all being respectful of the fact that they\u2019re married. We do hear things. But what the hell are we going to do now?\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard things, but we\u2019re numb now. We all have heard stuff \u2014 she\u2019s married. Whatever their situation is is whatever their situation is. Luann\u2019s not an idiot. Whatever Tom does, she probably knows. Whatever she does, he knows. Or they do nothing. It doesn\u2019t matter to any of us anymore. She\u2019s married. Do you boo!\u201d\n\nSinger concurred. \u201c[Luann\u2019s] happy now, that\u2019s all that counts. Her marriage is working and I\u2019m so happy,\u201d Singer said. \u201cShe has to accept him the way he is and that\u2019s it. And she\u2019s more than willing to accept it.\u201d\n\nrhony-reunion-2 Luann D\u2019Agostino\n\nThat may be the way Singer sees it, but Luann wasn\u2019t willing to accept everything \u2014 especially the rumors that she and Tom had an open marriage. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in an open relationship otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be married,\u201d she told Cohen. \u201cIt\u2019s not an arrangement \u2014 it\u2019s a marriage.\u201d\n\nAsked what she would do if those claims ended up having validity, Luann gave a swift answer. \u201cI would definitely leave,\u201d she told host Andy Cohen. \u201cI would. After I kill him. I\u2019d kill him first and then I\u2019d leave. You can push me so far but once you push me over the line\u2026\u201d\n\nThe mother of two also went back on her previous claim that she didn\u2019t want to hear rumors about Tom\u2019s cheating. It just depends on the source.\n\n\u201cI would want to hear that my husband went up to a hotel room in any capacity and said he was in an open relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to hear that but do you think I trust Ramona and her information? She calls her ex-girlfriends in California trying to get dirt on him. Which is Nancy Drew sneaky!\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Sonja Morgan Says She Won\u2019t Have A Relationship With Tom D\u2019Agostino Again: \u2018That\u2019s Done\u2019\n\nFrankel, shockingly, stood up for Singer. \u201cIn all fairness, I don\u2019t love her delivery but her content seems to be true,\u201d Frankel said. \u201cBecause the girl in L.A., I\u2019ve heard a similar thing. And I\u2019ve heard other things. It just seems like he\u2019s the type of person to go to a bar with one person and leave with another.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven the way you laugh about it now. You have an inhuman way about you where you have that countess shield up,\u201d Frankel said. \u201cOne of 10 things that he ever said to you, I\u2019d be in a ball. If I saw the episode that you saw, I\u2019d be crying in the bathroom.\u201d\n\nThere may be no tears from Luann, but she said Tom\u2019s behavior and the rumors have still hurt.\n\nIt\u2019s been especially tough on her family, including son Noel de Lesseps. \u201cIt was hard for [Noel] to accept [Tom] in the beginning because of what happened,\u201d Luann said. \u201cHe\u2019s my son \u2014 he\u2019s very protective of me. But he loves me, so he stands by my decision. They\u2019re not super close but they do [have their own relationship].\u201d\n\nF:PHOTOMediaFactory ActionsRequests DropBox46335#getty imagesGettyImages-546315050.jpg Luann and Tom D\u2019Agostino | Credit: Jimi Celeste/Patrick McMullan/Getty\n\nStill, Luann appeared to believe the two could work through it all \u2014 telling the Housewives she had accepted Tom for the way he is.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to change him at this point in his life. I\u2019m not going to tell him now, \u2018You can\u2019t go to the Regency,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI have suggested it. Listen \u2014 he\u2019s a grown man. A 50-year-old man who has lived his whole life as a bachelor. He has friends. I\u2019m friends with [my ex].\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now I like being Mrs. D\u2019Agostino,\u201d she explained. \u201cI don\u2019t miss my [countess] title. I like being Luann D\u2019Agostino.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Highlights of Luann de Lesseps & Tom D\u2019Agostino Jr.\u2019s Wedding\n\nThree weeks later, on Aug. 3, Luann announced on Twitter that she and Tom were divorcing, writing: \u201cIt\u2019s with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce We care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!\u201d\n\nDays after, she denied allegations that Tom had been unfaithful.\n\n\u201cI do not think Tom cheated on me, definitely not,\u201d Luann told Page Six when asked the reasons for their divorce. \u201cGod knows he\u2019s got himself in some trouble in the past, but I don\u2019t believe that continued [while we were married].\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was impossible, we were having problems and we tried really hard to fix things, and we finally came to the conclusion it was just not going to work,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt was a tough decision and we are both very sad about it. But the truth is we just weren\u2019t getting along.\u201d", "images":
