There's no word on who was driving that vehicle.\n\nBlac Chyna has remained quiet on social media since the incident occurred.\n\nIt's not the reality star's first time being involved in car drama. Back in 2015 she allowed a friend, another reality star named Paige Addison from the show \"Boss Nails,\" to drive her white BMW, and Paige subsequently got involved in a pretty serious accident and fled the scene.\n\nAt the time rumors swirled that Blac Chyna actually was behind the wheel, as witnesses claimed two African-American women in mini skirts ran from the BMW after smashing it into an Audi SUV. Chyna was eventually able to clear her name once Paige admitted she had been the one driving at the time of the accident.", "images":
