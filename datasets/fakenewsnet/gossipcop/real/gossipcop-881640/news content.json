News. \"I'm like, 'I need to keep this off!' I kinda wanna lose five more but actually keep the butt really big.\"\n\nAfter coming off a fairly well-received dance, she spoke about her diet, as well as the physical aspects of competing on the show.\n\n\"I'm eating more carbs than ever, which is crazy,\" she said. \"Not only are we training a lot but you're like flexing the whole time I feel like when you're dancing. It's like a really weird burn. It's like doing an interpretive dance all day long.\"\n\nAdriana M. Barraza/WENN.com\n\nMeanwhile, Nikki's fiance, WWE superstar John Cena likes what he sees in her.\n\nFayesVision/WENN.com\n\n\"He likes when I challenge myself and I think that's a turn-on for him so just coming and doing this and giving it my all, he loves that,\" she said. \"And plus I already got all these text messages from him, he was like, 'Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!' That was like the first one.\"\n\nWhether she wins \"DWTS\" remains to be seen, and she's hardly the odds-on favorite, but aside from her fit body, she's got something else out of the show: A choreographer for her the first dance at her wedding.\n\nWhile speaking to E!, her partner, Artem Chigvintsev, agreed to teach her a waltz for her upcoming nuptials. Until then, though, she'll keep sweating before the wedding!", "images": ["https://www.wonderwall.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/shutterstock_editorial_10547920d.jpg?h=1000",
