Apparently, the inmates will gather for the Thanksgiving dinner around 11:00 -- the same time when the former Dance Moms star will be in visitation.\n\nAn insider revealed to the outlet that their Thanksgiving meal will consist of \"dried up turkey, canned cranberry juice, canned corn, green beans, mashed potatoes, one roll with a small pad of butter, one slice of pumpkin pie, and one slice of pecan pie.\"\n\nDespite missing out on the meal, Abby Lee Miller will still be allowed to get her share of food once her visitor leaves, it has been claimed.\n\n\"Unfortunately, by the time Abby gets her meal, it will be cold,\" a source told the gossip site.\n\nPreviously, it has been reported that the controversial choreographer has not received any visits at the FCI Victorville in California. According to reports, the ALDC founder has been lonely in the past months, especially with no visitors.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/75bc5f8f-bdb6-4450-8b34-19f657ce2327.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d4beb6dae76d06be0ac3ac9fccf03064?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/321961ff-cff3-4da3-bb15-92c6c100f5d4.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/cb72b1bf-36aa-44a8-a6c7-835711fcfff0.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/cebf4a39-5da0-4fe2-abd5-23660bca8979.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/b61a3fab-062d-497a-9cba-8ea4f2d4a966.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/0bb6f898-74de-4517-965d-61d4feb5ccf4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4640667/how-dance-moms-star-abby-lee-miller-is-celebrating-her-first-thanksgiving-behind-bars/", "title": "How 'Dance Moms' Star Abby Lee Miller Is Celebrating Her First Thanksgiving Behind Bars", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How 'Dance Moms' Star Abby Lee Miller Is Celebrating Her First Thanksgiving Behind Bars", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4640667/how-dance-moms-star-abby-lee-miller-is-celebrating-her-first-thanksgiving-behind-bars/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "How 'Dance Moms' Star Abby Lee Miller Is Celebrating Her First Thanksgiving Behind Bars", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-11-23 00:47:07Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "How 'Dance Moms' Star Abby Lee Miller Is Celebrating Her First Thanksgiving Behind Bars", "keywords": "Rumors", "news_keywords": "Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511398027.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
