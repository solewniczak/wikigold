Oswalt told PEOPLE he and his wife were on cloud nine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only ever felt that level of joy once before in my life, and it was so profound and perfect it felt greedy to ever wish for it again,\u201d Oswalt said. \u201cBut I did, so now all I can do is show Meredith a level of gratitude and love that\u2019s greater than the joy she\u2019s brought me, and my daughter Alice. Because this is a new level of joy and a new life, and I\u2019ll always strive to deserve it.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s wedding came a little over a year after Oswalt\u2019s wife Michelle McNamara died unexpectedly in her sleep in April 2016, leaving the comedian to care for their 8-year-old daughter.\n\nmeredith-salenger-4-2000 Credit: Meredith Salenger Instagram\n\nBut Oswalt, Salenger and their closest friends and family strongly believe it was McNamara who orchestrated their meeting from above.\n\n\u201cWhen I first starting talking with Patton on Facebook, it was just sort of witty banter,\u201d Salenger said. \u201cThere was nothing to it, but as I started getting to know him better, I looked up Michelle on Facebook and I saw that we had like 15 mutual friends. One of them was my best friend since 7th grade. I called her and was like, \u2018Tell me about Michelle.\u2019 She was best friends with Michelle after college. She was like, \u2018I loved her. She\u2019s amazing. She\u2019s so funny and smart.'\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cFinding out about Michelle made me love Patton even more. I was like, \u2018He likes smart girls and he likes good girls.\u2019 That was something that made me think more highly of Patton because he loved a girl that was like us \u2013 me and my friends. My friend said, \u2018I think Michelle orchestrated this from heaven. She asked herself, who would be the best woman to raise Alice? And she picked you. And then, who would Patton love? You.\u2019\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Patton Oswalt Opens Up About Emotional Wedding to Meredith Salenger: \u2018This Is a New Level of Joy and a New Life\u2019\n\nNow, the family of three is looking forward to the next chapter.", "images": ["https://people.com/img/misc/og-default.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fmeredith-salenger-5-2000-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fmeredith-salenger-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fmeredith-salenger-8-2000-1-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fmeredith-salenger-4-2000-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fmeredith-salenger-2-2000-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fmeredith-salenger-3-2000-1-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/img/misc/og-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexia Fern\u00e1ndez", "December"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/patton-oswalt-and-his-daughter-introduces-his-new-wife-to-her-first-ever-christmas-tree/", "title": "Patton Oswalt Celebrates First Christmas with Meredith Salenger", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Christmas,Holidays,News,Patton Oswalt", "news_keywords": "Christmas,Holidays,News,Patton Oswalt", "description": "This year will be the actor and his daughter Alice's first Christmas with the star's new wife Meredith Salenger", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Patton Oswalt Celebrates First Christmas with Meredith Salenger", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/patton-oswalt-and-his-daughter-introduces-his-new-wife-to-her-first-ever-christmas-tree/", "description": "This year will be the actor and his daughter Alice's first Christmas with the star's new wife Meredith Salenger", "image": "https://people.com/img/misc/og-default.png"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/patton-oswalt-and-his-daughter-introduces-his-new-wife-to-her-first-ever-christmas-tree/", "media": "https://people.com/img/misc/og-default.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/patton-oswalt-and-his-daughter-introduces-his-new-wife-to-her-first-ever-christmas-tree/", "title": "Patton Oswalt Celebrates First Christmas with Meredith Salenger", "description": "This year will be the actor and his daughter Alice's first Christmas with the star's new wife Meredith Salenger", "site": "@people", "image": "https://people.com/img/misc/og-default.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/patton-oswalt-and-his-daughter-introduces-his-new-wife-to-her-first-ever-christmas-tree/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
