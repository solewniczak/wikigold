They come in handy little spray bottles, they fit perfectly into your purse, and they can be used as a midday pick-me-up. Depending on the formula, a face mist can help perk up tired-looking skin, prep and set the skin for makeup, or provide an additional boost of hydration\u2014which can be particularly helpful if you have dry skin. So if you\u2019re currently looking for a mist to add to your beauty routine\u2014you\u2019ve come to the right place. Keep reading to learn more about our favorite facial mist and the different ways you can use it.\n\nWhy Should You Use A Face Mist?\n\nFace mists are typically known for their moisturizing abilities, making it a great product to use year-round when the weather changes or if you have a dry skin type. During the winter, the skin tends to get dull and dry because there is less moisture in the air, which can leave you with parched-looking skin\u2014a face mist would be the perfect solution to help with that. In warmer temperatures, you can use a face mist to refresh and cool down after being exposed to the sun, especially if you store the bottle in your refrigerator overnight. Its nourishing ingredients can also help restore moisture that the sun may have dried out.\n\nOur Best Face Mist\n\nThe L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris True Match Lumi Shake and Glow Dew Mist primes, sets, and refreshes makeup for a natural, healthy-looking glow. Formulated with coconut water and vitamin C, this hydrating face mist works to awaken the skin and revive your complexion. Not all face mists are designed to work as a setting spray, but this one does double duty and can be used to prep your skin for makeup or as a setting spray to finish off a look with a natural, dewy glow. To use, give the bottle a quick shake and spray it onto clean skin every morning and night. We recommend spritzing it before applying a moisturizer to seal in the hydration.\n\nThree Unique Ways To Use A Face Mist\n\nAs Soon As You Wake Up In The Morning\n\nSplashing your face with cold water is not the only way to help wake yourself up in the morning. A few spritzes of face mist can have you feeling rejuvenated in no time! Plus, your skin will thank you for providing it with a healthy coat of nourishing ingredients such as vitamin C and coconut water.\n\nTo Smooth Out A Cakey Makeup Look\n\nIf you\u2019ve used a little too much product when applying your makeup, you don\u2019t have to remove it all. Instead, spritz your entire face with a mist, and then add some more over target areas that need work. Use your ring finger to tap and blend in the product until you see a more natural finish. You can also spray the product onto a makeup blender and dab it onto the areas that look cakey or patchy.\n\nAs A Toner Swap\n\nIn case you run ever out of toner or forget to pack one, you can easily use a face mist in its place to nourish and replenish the skin right after cleansing. Just spray a generous amount onto a cotton pad and gently massage it around your entire face.\n\nThere are also face mists that can do more than hydrate. From sunscreen sprays that apply just like a regular face mist to shimmery formulas that give your skin a glowy boost, there are various options you can choose from based on your skin care concerns.\n\nPhoto Credit: Matthew Zach, Senior Art Director: Melissa San Vicente-Landestoy\n\nNext: 6 Common Signs Of Dull Skin And How To Care For It", "images": ["https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/shared/baseline/navigationext/l-oreal-paris-youtube.svg?h=100&w=200&la=en-US&hash=F0939BE48C3D4FA3E5B8DB6959F02C23773BC738", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/shared/baseline/navigationext/loreal-paris-black-logo.svg?h=372&w=990&la=en-US&hash=F51FCBD9EB0E7BA391C7A313BBE64400E30CCB3E", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/wsf_bmag_logo.png?h=146&w=1263&la=en-US&hash=26D1B86ECC30B6F3EA3CA93B96E93E1116FE7A84", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/shared/baseline/navigationext/loreal-paris-white-logo.svg?la=en-US&hash=DF5A71B4C2F2E19584AC097C6965EC6AAE4AF16E", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/shared/baseline/social-buttons-icons/facebook-black.svg", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/americas/us/beauty-magazine/categories/hero/rvg0004_foundation-texture_2-(1).jpg?h=1080&w=1920&la=en-US&hash=B4FF525970240EC52246CB16F2040A4A86EC3055", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/shared/baseline/navigationext/l-oreal-paris-facebook.svg?h=100&w=200&la=en-US&hash=926518BD682A42A04C798DF6EE0175C0EDC43A76", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/shared/baseline/navigationext/l-oreal-paris-twitter.svg?h=100&w=200&la=en-US&hash=EF3B652A1702FBE55ACCDEAF2ABF961CCB3F1156", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/shared/baseline/social-buttons-icons/twitter-black.svg", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/shared/baseline/navigationext/l-oreal-paris-instagram.svg?h=100&w=200&la=en-US&hash=8540D3B6857823CC3A4FC9E018BE6A2CAC32D23A", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/americas/us/beauty-magazine/categories/hero/skincare_50.jpg?h=2250&w=3372&la=en-US&hash=D2E66210ACEFF5A73CE6A03CD1812899CE9A9A2B", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/americas/us/beauty-magazine/2021/march/3-17/facial-mist/what-are-face-mists-hero-bmag.jpg", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/americas/us/beauty-magazine/categories/hero/haircare.jpg?h=1667&w=2500&la=en-US&hash=2C98626F3062D565FB3599F86E0CADA858C58987", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/americas/us/beauty-magazine/navigation/bmag-nav-hairstyle.png?h=325&w=488&la=en-US&hash=B7FC61C20CE8381CE8DF606C76FE1FEA2D2E16F0", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mM88x8AAp0BzdNtlUkAAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/americas/us/beauty-magazine/categories/hero/haircolor-2.jpg?h=1080&w=1920&la=en-US&hash=12CBC0A56EDDA803CEA76D9387A50CBB59D64564", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/shared/baseline/social-buttons-icons/email.svg", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/americas/us/beauty-magazine/categories/hero/beauty-tips-nav.jpg?h=1400&w=2100&la=en-US&hash=4FC7616F2D1469DBF21E80C930B2ABF1581FE35F", "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/shared/baseline/social-buttons-icons/link.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/americas/us/beauty-magazine/2021/march/3-17/facial-mist/what-are-face-mists-hero-bmag.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/beauty-magazine/skin-care/skin-care-essentials/facial-mist-and-setting-spray", "title": "Why You Should Keep This Face Mist Stashed In Your Bag", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "VIcurrentDateTime": 637830056742523008, "og": {"description": "Discover the article Why You Should Keep This Face Mist Stashed In Your Bag", "type": "article", "site_name": "L'Or\u00e9al Paris", "image": "https://www.lorealparisusa.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/oap/americas/us/beauty-magazine/2021/march/3-17/facial-mist/what-are-face-mists-hero-bmag.jpg", "title": "Why You Should Keep This Face Mist Stashed In Your Bag -
