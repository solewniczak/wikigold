And while Peter made a superb first impression, it seems Copper is now the early front-runner for the final rose.\n\nHopefully this a sign that a dog-based Bachelor show is on the horizon; one where all the contestants have dogs and can only date the Bachelor/Bachelorette if their dogs get along.\n\nUntil this dream comes true, we are focused on finding out as much as we can about Rachel\u2019s dreamy dog. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve dug up on Copper so far.\n\nHe is Rachel\u2019s best friend, obviously.\n\nHe is wearing a cast because he broke his toe \u201cjumping off something.\u201d\n\nHe works to keep his gloriously fluffy coat in check.\n\nThe party Copper, Peter and Rachel attended was a mini West Coast follow-up to the giant BarkFest party BarkBox hosts in N.Y.C. every year.\n\nYou can get the rose bouquet toy Copper enjoyed on the show for your own pup, to show he\u2019ll always be your final rose pick.\n\nbarkbox Credit: BarkShop\n\nThe Bachelorette", "images":
