In 2017, the loveable Boykin died. He was only 45 years old.\n\nIf you ever watched the MTV reality series, then you knew how unpredictably funny the show and he was.\n\nThe reality series follows professional skateboarder Rob Dyrdek and his bodyguard, Big Black. The two live together in the Hollywood Hills and hatch crazy plans. One week they decide to teach Meaty the bulldog to skateboard and another they buy a miniature horse that they plan to keep in their backyard. Full of practical jokes and funny stunts, Rob and Big are complete opposites who share with viewers their odd lives as best friends.\n\n\u2018Rob & Big\u2019 quickly established a digital fanbase, becoming one of MTV\u2019s fastest and best-selling shows on iTunes. Season one was the second most downloaded MTV series on iTunes behind \u201cThe Hills.\u201d The first full season of Rob & Big reached over 70 million total viewers and ranked #1 in its time period among 12-34 year-olds.\n\nYou May Also Like Worst Cities for Spring Allergies 2022: Is Your City on the List?\n\nBoykin had a defibrillator implant for his heart.

Born in Chicago, IL, but growing up in Mississippi, Big Black was a former U.S. Navy Serviceman and had over 10 years of Executive Protection experience. He was been embraced by the skateboarding community since teaming up with Rob and DC Shoes and was recognized everywhere he went. Much like Rob, Big Black also has an entrepreneurial spirit, creating his own clothing line and multiple other businesses.\n\nYou May Also Like Is Your Child Complaining About Joint Pain?\n\nHis skateboarder co-star and friend took to Instagram to express his grief over the loss of his best friend.\n\n\u201cMy heart is broken.
