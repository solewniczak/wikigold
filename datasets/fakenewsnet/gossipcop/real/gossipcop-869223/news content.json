But lucky for us, the 41-year-old Oscar winner (and former model) doesn\u2019t settle for something less than spectacular.\n\n\u201cCharlize\u2019s style is sexy and sophisticated,\u201d says stylist Leslie Fremar, who has been dressing the actress since she starred in 2008\u2019s Hancock. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t really follow the trends but, instead, she makes choices based on her body and what she feels comfortable in. And since she doesn't go for anything too elaborate, the clothes never really take over. She wears the looks\u2014 they don\u2019t wear her.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Theron has developed a fashion formula that always seems to land her on the best-dressed list. Her trademarks? Clean silhouettes, a modern neutral palette with a touch of embellishment, and lots of plunging necklines, which her stylist says is a fave. \u201cShe\u2019s tall and lean with broad shoulders, so deep-Vs are great on her because they bring the eye down,\u201d adds Fremar.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BFCg-mBhGcr/?taken-by=lesliefremar&hl=en\n\nAlso on Theron's must-wear list? Lots and lots of Dior. \u201cShe obviously has such a great relationship with the brand being the face of the J\u2019Adore fragrance,\u201d says Fremar. \u201cBeyond that, it\u2019s a beautiful, elegant brand and she is a beautiful, elegant person. It just makes sense. She also appreciates the artistry behind their creations.\"\n\nFrench fashion houses aside, it\u2019s the star\u2019s confidence that takes her look to the next level. \u201cNot everyone likes the red carpet,\u201d says Fremar. \u201cSome celebrities get nervous, some find it intimidating, but the cool thing about Charlize is that she really enjoys it, and for lack of a better word, plays the part.\u201d\n\nCheck out Theron\u2019s latest film, Kubo and the Two Strings, in theaters Friday.
