A lot of negativity,\u201d she told PEOPLE in July, when looking back on her time on the show. \u201cI just was extremely frustrated \u2014 it just was really a trying season for me. I had had enough.\u201d\n\nBut after years of being away from RHOA, Zolciak-Biermann returned to the show for Shere\u00e9 Whitfield\u2019s housewarming party at the season 9 finale \u2014 where she quickly butted heads with Kenya Moore.\n\nAsked at the time if she would consider rejoining the show for its 10th season, Zolciak-Biermann told PEOPLE she would consider it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very motivated by money,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything has a price.
