did appear to update a few of her captions to reflect the fact that she re-posted the images from other sources.\n\nWhile Stylecaster reported the actress initially captioned a photograph of a red door \u201cSHANGHAI\u201d and an image of Chinese city Xi\u2019an\u2019s world-famous Terracotta Warriors as \u201cTerracotta Army: Xi\u2019an,\u201d both photo captions currently acknowledge she did not take the photographs herself.\n\nIn the comments section of one of the Instagram photos, a fan claimed that Mitchell had changed the captions, writing: \u201cbefore she removed a couple of the photos and edited her captions, she did tag the locations and herself like she was actually there.\u201d\n\nMitchell previously revealed she gets \u201ca little angry\u201d when people fake food photos they post on Instagram.\n\n\u201cI love a great food shot and I follow a lot of food blogs,\u201d Mitchell told PEOPLE last month. \u201cBut if I ever find out that you don\u2019t really eat that food, and you just used it for a photo, that\u2019s when I get a little angry \u2014 not only because you\u2019re wasting it, but because someone like me could have enjoyed it.\u201d", "images":
