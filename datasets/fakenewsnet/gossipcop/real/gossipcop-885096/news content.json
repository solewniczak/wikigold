A woman who has really nice, looked-after skin is such a turn-on for me. It\u2019s always sexy.\u201d\n\nSex-appeal aside, Elba is typically known as a tough guy in his TV roles. But there\u2019s one person with a real knack for turning him to mush: His daughter, Isan. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s with me now for three weeks and I love it; I absolutely love it,\u201d Elba tells the magazine. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019d manage to be on seven flights a month and still get her to school.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://people.com/img/misc/og-default.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2011%2F10%2Fidris-elba-300.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/img/misc/og-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sara Hammel", "Updated October"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/celebrity/idris-elba-talks-turn-ons-in-essence-magazine/", "title": "Idris Elba Talks Turn-Ons in Essence Magazine", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Idris Elba", "news_keywords": "Idris Elba", "description": "\"I love beautiful skin,\" says the Emmy-nominated actor, adding that he's \"very tactile\"", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Idris Elba Talks Turn-Ons in Essence Magazine", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/celebrity/idris-elba-talks-turn-ons-in-essence-magazine/", "description": "\"I love beautiful skin,\" says the Emmy-nominated actor, adding that he's \"very tactile\"", "image": "https://people.com/img/misc/og-default.png"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/celebrity/idris-elba-talks-turn-ons-in-essence-magazine/", "media": "https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2011/10/idris-elba-300.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/celebrity/idris-elba-talks-turn-ons-in-essence-magazine/", "title": "Idris Elba Talks Turn-Ons in Essence Magazine", "description": "\"I love beautiful skin,\" says the Emmy-nominated actor, adding that he's \"very tactile\"", "site": "@people", "image": "https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2011/10/idris-elba-300.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/celebrity/idris-elba-talks-turn-ons-in-essence-magazine/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
