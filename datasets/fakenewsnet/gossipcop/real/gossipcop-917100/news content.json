A Virginia judge wasn\u2019t convinced it was enough to drop the felony cocaine possession charge against the \u201cCharmed\u201d actress.\n\nJudge Deborah Welsh of Loudoun County General District Court on Monday denied McGowan\u2019s motion to dismiss the case from January 2017, when an airplane cleaning crew found McGowan\u2019s wallet next to the seat she had occupied for a flight to Dulles International Airport. The wallet allegedly contained two bags that tested positive for cocaine.\n\nMcGowan\u2019s lawyer filed paperwork in February claiming Weinstein might have set up the actress.\n\n\u201cIt is now public knowledge that Weinstein employed underhanded tactics to \u2018silence\u2019 his victims,\u201d Jessica Carmichael said in court documents, according to the People. It has been reported that Weinstein hired intelligence agencies to spy on his accusers.\n\nCarmichael also said five hours elapsed from when her client deplaned to the time that her wallet discovered.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no point in time at which the evidence places Ms. McGowan and the cocaine together in the same place,\u201d she wrote, according to the Daily News.\n\nJudge Welsh said it would be premature to dismiss charges against McGowan prior to her March 21 preliminary date. Prosecutors have also said they have additional evidence that were not included in the original charges filed against McGowan.\n\nMcGowan herself floated the idea that Weinstein was retaliating against her for her naming him as her alleged rapist.\n\nRelated Articles Report sheds light on injuries sustained by Bob Saget\n\nMeghan Markle\u2019s half-sister and the dark world of pregnancy truthers\n\nJohn Cho talks writing middle-grade novel about LA riots and return to \u2018Star Trek\u2019\n\n\u2018Dexter\u2019 star Michael C.
