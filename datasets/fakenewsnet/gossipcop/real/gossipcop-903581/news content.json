Chloe Kim\u2019s incredible gold-medal run\n\n2. Team USA\u2019s Curling gold that\u2019s straight out of Hollywood\n\nAfter disastrous finishes at the last two Olympic Games, Team USA won its first-ever gold by stunning Sweden.\n\n3. The U.S. women\u2019s hockey team beating Canada to win gold, 20 years after Nagano \u201998\n\n4. Gus Kenworthy adopting a dog at the Olympics (again)\n\n5. Adam Rippon\u2019s dazzling free skate\n\nRippon helped Team USA take bronze in the team event.\n\nGerard wasn\u2019t one of the favorites to win men\u2019s slopestyle, but just like Sage Kotsenburg did four years ago in Sochi, Gerard stormed to the top of the podium with a stellar run.\n\n8. Chris Mazdzer winning Team USA\u2019s first-ever men\u2019s singles luge medal\n\n9. Ester Ledecka\u2019s double gold\n\nLedecka, a world champion snowboarder, came to these Games without a single career top-10 finish on skis. She not only stunned the world by winning women\u2019s super-G, but dominated parallel snowboard giant slalom to become the first athlete to win gold in skiing and snowboarding competitions at the same games.\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t finish last in cross country!\n\n11. Unified Korea\u2019s entrance to the 2018 Winter Games\n\n14. The epic duel between Alina Zagitova and Evgenia Medvedeva\n\nZagitova, a 15-year-old, barely edged Medvedeva by just over a point to take gold in a competition for the ages.\n\n16. Elizabeth Swaney living out Olympic dreams thanks to loopholes\n\nTake that, haters.\n\nAlong with the incredible call of Kikkan Randall and Jessie Diggins winning gold.\n\n19. Yuzuru Hanyu repeating as men\u2019s figure skating gold medalist for the first time since Dick Button\n\n20. South Korea\u2019s Iron Man wins gold\n\n23-year-old Yung Sungbin build up a big enough lead in men\u2019s skeleton that his final run was essentially a victory lap, and the home crowd went nuts for him.\n\n21. Chloe Kim establishing herself as the greatest Olympic Twitterer\n\n22. Mark McMorris\u2019 inspiring comeback\n\nMcMorris suffered near-fatal injuries last March after hitting a tree in the backcountry of British Columbia and needed two surgeries after suffering a fractured jaw, a fractured left arm, a ruptured spleen, a pelvic fracture, rib fractures and a collapsed left lung. Less than a year later, he was back on the Olympic stage, and he left Pyeongchang with a bronze medal.\n\n23. Two-man bobsled ends in a gold-medal tie.\n\nGermany and Canada split the golds after the two countries put up the exact same time down to the hundredth of a second.", "images": ["https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2020/08/usat-logo-mobile-off-canvas.png", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2022/03/USATSI_17852521.jpg?w=192&h=150&crop=1", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2022/03/EA_Play_E32019.jpg?w=192&h=150&crop=1", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2020/08/usat-logo-header-rev1.png", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2022/03/USATSI_17585267.jpg?w=192&h=150&crop=1", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2022/03/USATSI_17881200.jpg?w=192&h=150&crop=1", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2015/11/ftw-icon-section-head.png", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2018/02/ap_olympics_gold_medal_branding_975691321-e1519654234765.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2022/03/USATSI_17776068.jpg?w=192&h=150&crop=1", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2018/02/ap_olympics_gold_medal_branding_975691321-e1519654234765.jpg?w=1000&h=600&crop=1", "https://wp.usatodaysports.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2018/02/korea.jpg", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2016/02/11218827_1653821114855641_553053569454999342_n.jpg?w=90&h=90", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2019/05/ftw_icon_rgb-reverse-1.png", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2022/03/USATSI_15642784.jpg?w=192&h=150&crop=1", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2020/08/logo-usat-footer.png", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2022/03/baker.jpeg?w=192&h=150&crop=1", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2022/03/USATSI_17868375-1.jpg?w=192&h=150&crop=1", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2022/03/USATSI_17873449.jpg?w=192&h=150&crop=1", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2022/03/Hogwarts_Legacy_Screenshot4545.png?w=192&h=150&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2018/02/ap_olympics_gold_medal_branding_975691321-e1519654234765.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Charles Curtis", "Nick Schwartz", "Caroline Darney", "Ftw Staff", "Kyle Campbell", "February", "Am Et", "Charles Is A Writer For For The Win.
