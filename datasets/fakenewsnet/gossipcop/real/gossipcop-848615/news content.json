Reese Witherspoon is a fan of Goldie Hawn, and she made this fact abundantly clear during a speech she gave at the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Both Hawn and her significant other, Kurt Russell, received stars this year. It\u2019s about time.\n\nWitherspoon was able to give Hawn her own little tribute at the event, and it was so emotional that she was holding back tears. In her eyes, Hawn is her idol, and someone she looked up to throughout her own acting career.\n\nIf you want to know how much Witherspoon loves Hawn, check this out: She made her own pin for the big moment.\n\n\"I had to go down and make an \u2018I love Goldie' button because I am literally her biggest fan,\" Witherspoon said.\n\nVariety posted the full speech on Twitter, and it\u2019s making us laugh and cry.\n\nWitherspoon\u2019s fandom, which was revealed throughout the seven minutes, makes us appreciate her even more.\n\n\"My very first e-mail address was Overboard@aol.com,\" she admitted.\n\nUm, that\u2019s kind of adorable.\n\nWitherspoon also admitted to the audience that she actually printed out and framed a text she once got from Hawn.\n\nEven better, she pointed out that a lot of Hawn\u2019s roles gave inspiration to women. She even credited the 1986 movie Wildcats, and Hawn\u2019s role as Molly McGrath, for proving to her that women could be tough, funny, feminine, and warm all at once. Witherspoon also said that Hawn helped her figure out the real meaning of feminism.\n\nBoth of these two ladies inspire us immensely, and we\u2019re so happy that Hawn is finally receiving such an incredible honor!", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F20%2Fsex-anxiety-tout.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F02%2F09%2FSwimsuits.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/misc/300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F17%2Fboob-sweat.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2016%2F07%2F27%2Fkarenbelz-300x225-1.jpeg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Fyuliya-kosolapova-bqirdOGHvYQ-unsplash-e1573767747444.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=985&h=493&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F05%2F05%2FGettyImages-678897418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F07%2F08%2Fchiron-retrograde-2021.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F06%2F08%2Ffriendquestions-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fdream_about_ex.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=985&h=493&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F05%2F05%2FGettyImages-678897418.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Belz", "Updated May"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/reese-witherspoon-gave-a-tear-filled-speech-about-goldie-hawn-at-the-hollywood-walk-of-fame/", "title": "Reese Witherspoon gave a tearful speech about Goldie Hawn at the Hollywood Walk of Fame", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "reese witherspoon", "news_keywords": "reese witherspoon", "description": "Witherspoon credited the actress for showing her how powerful women can truly be.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Reese Witherspoon gave a tearful speech about Goldie Hawn at the Hollywood Walk of Fame", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/reese-witherspoon-gave-a-tear-filled-speech-about-goldie-hawn-at-the-hollywood-walk-of-fame/", "description": "Witherspoon credited the actress for showing her how powerful women can truly be.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=985&h=493&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F05%2F05%2FGettyImages-678897418.jpg", "width": 985, "height": 493}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/reese-witherspoon-gave-a-tear-filled-speech-about-goldie-hawn-at-the-hollywood-walk-of-fame/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F05%2F05%2FGettyImages-678897418.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/reese-witherspoon-gave-a-tear-filled-speech-about-goldie-hawn-at-the-hollywood-walk-of-fame/", "title": "Reese Witherspoon gave a tearful speech about Goldie Hawn at the Hollywood Walk of Fame", "description": "Witherspoon credited the actress for showing her how powerful women can truly be.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=985&h=493&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F05%2F05%2FGettyImages-678897418.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/reese-witherspoon-gave-a-tear-filled-speech-about-goldie-hawn-at-the-hollywood-walk-of-fame/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
