News personality returned to host the network\u2019s pre-Oscars red carpet show for the 90th Academy Awards on Sunday \u2014 but things got a little sticky during a segment with chef Wolfgang Puck, who has been responsible for feeding the stars at the Governors Ball, the official post-Oscars celebration, for over 20 years.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nAs Puck, 68, was running down his menu for the night, he offered Rancic, 43, one of his famous chocolate Oscar statuettes \u2014 which were filled with passion fruit chocolate, to Rancic\u2019s surprise. After she took a bite, a small piece snapped off and fell down the front of her stunning cream-colored gown.\n\nOf course, Rancic took it all in stride and laughed the moment off. (Luckily, it didn\u2019t stain!)\n\nF:PHOTOMediaFactory ActionsRequests DropBox3000#screencapsSNAG-0362.jpg Wolfgang Puck (left) and Giuliana Rancic\n\n90th Annual Academy Awards - Arrivals Giuliana Rancic at the 90th Annual Academy Awards | Credit: Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nWatch PEOPLE & Entertainment Weekly Red Carpet Live this Sunday, March 4 at 5 p.m. ET/ 2 p.m. PT.
