None who ever won an Indy race and none with as many top-10 finishes as her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a strong woman, and she went through a lot in her career.

met in 2012 \u2014 and exchanged email addresses \u2014 it took years before their relationship became romantic.\n\n\u201cWe kept in touch a little bit, and there were some years we didn\u2019t talk to each other, and then some every now and again, but it wasn\u2019t until obviously recently that we actually had phone numbers,\u201d Patrick, a longtime fan of Packers rivals, the Chicago Bears, recalled while appearing on Jenny McCarthy\u2019s SiriusXM in May. \u201cWe referred to each other as Chicago and Green Bay \u2014 it was very cute.\u201d", "images":
