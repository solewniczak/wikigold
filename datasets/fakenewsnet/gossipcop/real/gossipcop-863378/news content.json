It was hard for me. It was really just a rough time for my family. My mom came out and is staying with me. I\u2019m better.\u201d\n\nIn June, production on season 4 was temporarily suspended after two show producers voiced their concerns after a sexual encounter between Olympios and Jackson was caught on camera.\n\nBACHELOR IN PARADISE - DEMARIO JACKSON and CORINNE OLYMPIOS\n\nWarner Bros. initiated an investigation of the alleged misconduct, all the contestants were sent home, and Olympios and Jackson both retained legal counsel.\n\n\u201cI am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4. Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place, which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production,\u201d Olympios said in a statement to PEOPLE.\n\nAfter receiving backlash from Bachelor Nation fans and former costars, Olympios clarified a few things \u2014 including what she meant by calling herself a \u201cvictim.\u201d\n\ncorinne-o Credit: Getty (2)\n\n\u201cAt that point in time, I saw myself as a victim of having something this serious happen to you and have the media paint you a certain way that you know you aren\u2019t and having all these people make their judgments and comments and they don\u2019t even know what happened or went on,\u201d she exclusively tells PEOPLE in this week\u2019s issue. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m a victim of. I never meant that I was a victim of DeMario. I strongly believe he had no bad intentions at all. It was all good. It was unfortunate that no one really knew how intoxicated I actually was at the time. I believe that nobody knew that. It was nobody\u2019s fault. I was a victim of not really knowing what happened at the time. We were just really trying to get to bottom of everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that this is finally coming to an end,\u201d she adds.\n\nFor more on Olympios and Bachelor in Paradise, pick up this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday\n\nLast week, Jackson had a similar opportunity and opened up to Harrison about his struggles post-scandal.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult because I know who I am,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI know I\u2019m not that monster that they\u2019re trying to portray on TV. Like Michelle Obama said, \u2018When they go low, you go high.\u2019 It was hard to go high. I had to do it because I train and mentor children and I can\u2019t tell them to be something that I\u2019m not. That\u2019s what kept me going \u2013 and great family, friends, school teachers, people at the gym \u2026 it was just crazy to see the response from them. My castmates \u2013 Alexis, Raven, I think I FaceTimed Taylor every single day. There was so much love. I was extremely humbled.\u201d\n\n147277_4885 Credit: Paul Hebert/ABC\n\nWhile Olympios continues to move forward, she can\u2019t help but reflect on what she took from this whole experience.\n\n\u201cWith something like this, you can\u2019t help but learn a lot about yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cI really learned a lot about myself. I need to be more aware of my body and medicines I put in my body. I need to just be more aware of my surroundings.\u201d\n\nOlympios says she was taking a medication that reacted negatively with her alcohol consumption, prompting a \u201csevere black-out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI drank a little too much when I was on medication,\u201d she says. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been drinking that much and mixing different alcohols.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only regret I have is letting myself drink too much \u2014 that\u2019s it,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt was unfortunate. But you know what, I\u2019m an adult and I have to move past it.\u201d\n\nThough she has not spoken to Jackson since production had been suspended, she wishes him nothing but the best.\n\n\u201cI would want to tell him, \u2018Listen, I respect you as a human,\u2019 \u201d she told Harrison. \u201d \u2018I have nothing against you. I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through this. I know what it feels like. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 \u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fdemario-jackson-bip1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fbachelor-paradise-2-2000-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1250&h=625&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fcorinne-o.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fcorinne-o.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1250&h=625&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fcorinne-o.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christina Dugan Ramirez", "August"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/corinne-olympios-apologizes-to-demario-jackson-bip-sex-scandal/", "title": "Corinne Olympios Apologizes to DeMario Jackson over BiP Sex Scandal", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Bachelor in Paradise,Corinne Olympios,DeMario Jackson,News", "news_keywords": "Bachelor in Paradise,Corinne Olympios,DeMario Jackson,News", "description": "Olympios sat down with host Chris Harrison to discuss the sex scandal that halted production on season 4 of BiP", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Corinne Olympios Apologizes to DeMario Jackson over BiP Sex Scandal", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/corinne-olympios-apologizes-to-demario-jackson-bip-sex-scandal/", "description": "Olympios sat down with host Chris Harrison to discuss the sex scandal that halted production on season 4 of BiP", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1250&h=625&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fcorinne-o.jpg", "width": 1250, "height": 625}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/corinne-olympios-apologizes-to-demario-jackson-bip-sex-scandal/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fcorinne-o.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/corinne-olympios-apologizes-to-demario-jackson-bip-sex-scandal/", "title": "Corinne Olympios Apologizes to DeMario Jackson over BiP Sex Scandal", "description": "Olympios sat down with host Chris Harrison to discuss the sex scandal that halted production on season 4 of BiP", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1250&h=625&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fcorinne-o.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/corinne-olympios-apologizes-to-demario-jackson-bip-sex-scandal/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
