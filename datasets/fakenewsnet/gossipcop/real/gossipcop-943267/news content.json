He was 29.\n\nHis death came five years before the death of the Olympic skier\u2019s beloved daughter.\n\n\u201cWe are beyond devastated. Our baby girl, Emmy, passed away yesterday. Never in a million years did we think we would experience a pain like this,\u201d the 40-year-old Olympic alpine skier said on Instagram Monday.\n\n\u201cHer love, her light, her spirit will never be forgotten. Our little girl loved life and lived it to it\u2019s fullest everyday. Our family respectfully requests privacy during this painful time,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Bode excelled on skis, Chilly mastered the mountain on a snowboard \u2014 and hoped to take his skills to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. But it was not meant to be.\n\nHowever, Bode did compete at the Games while grieving his brother, and told Access Hollywood in 2013 that he hoped to turn his grief into \u201cinspiration.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think for one thing, it\u2019s too fresh. Any time you\u2019re gathering emotional energy to channel into something, it has to be fairly contained and it has to be real but it also has to be something you feel confident in unleashing and I think that\u2019s still pretty fresh,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s more just a tragedy. I can use it and turn it in some way for inspiration because, like you said, he had wanted to go to the Olympics and he\u2019s just my little brother \u2014 I had seen him compete his whole life.\u201d\n\nThe athlete continued, \u201cI probably prefer just to mourn and be normal about it and treat my Olympics the way that it\u2019s meant to be treated. I\u2019m confident that I can go in there and win.\u201d\n\nAlpine Skiing - Winter Olympics Day 9 Bode Miller | Credit: Doug Pensinger/Getty\n\nHowever, Bode was overcome with emotion in a post-race interview after winning the bronze medal in the super-G, and breaking his own record as the most decorated American Alpine skier in Olympic history.\n\n\u201cIt was really hard and just attached emotion to that he wanted to come to these Games. I thought that he would probably have a chance at making it, then for him to pass away the way that he did really kind of connected with my journey coming back,\u201d he explained in a press conference, according to a video from the Washington Post. \u201cToday I felt like that was all very connected and very raw and emotional for me.\n\nFollowing the race, Bode tweeted a message to his fans.\n\n\u201cThanks for all the support, today was one of the most emotional days of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI miss my brother.\u201d\n\nHe also defended NBC reporter Christin Cooper, whom some accused of pushing too hard with her questions following the race, and causing Bode to break down in tears.\n\n\u201cI appreciate everyone sticking up for me. Please be gentle w christin cooper, it was crazy emotional and not all her fault,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nIn a December 2013 interview with the Associated Press, Bode also said that he and his brother were very close.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1580&h=790&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fbode-miller2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fbode-miller2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1580&h=790&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fbode-miller2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit", "June"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/sports/how-bode-miller-coped-brother-death/", "title": "How Bode Miller Coped with His Brother's Tragic Death Before Losing His 19-Month-Old Daughter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Bode Miller,Death,News", "news_keywords": "Bode Miller,Death,News", "description": "In April 2013, Bode Miller's brother Chelone \"Chilly\" Miller died of an apparent seizure", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "How Bode Miller Coped with His Brother's Tragic Death Before Losing His 19-Month-Old Daughter", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/sports/how-bode-miller-coped-brother-death/", "description": "In April 2013, Bode Miller's brother Chelone \"Chilly\" Miller died of an apparent seizure", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1580&h=790&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fbode-miller2.jpg", "width": 1580, "height": 790}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/sports/how-bode-miller-coped-brother-death/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fbode-miller2.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/sports/how-bode-miller-coped-brother-death/", "title": "How Bode Miller Coped with His Brother's Tragic Death Before Losing His 19-Month-Old Daughter", "description": "In April 2013, Bode Miller's brother Chelone \"Chilly\" Miller died of an apparent seizure", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1580&h=790&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fbode-miller2.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/sports/how-bode-miller-coped-brother-death/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
