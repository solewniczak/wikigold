The love you have all shown me will never be forgotten and I look forward to the day where I can say I came out on the other side. I will keep fighting.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Demi Lovato\u2019s Mom Breaks Silence on Overdose: \u2018We Didn\u2019t Know If She Was Going to Make It\u2019\n\nThe star revealed she celebrated six years of sobriety in March \u2014 but just three months later, she opened up about a recent relapse when she released her autobiographical single \u201cSober\u201d on June 21.\n\nRecently, Lovato\u2019s mother, Dianna De La Garza, shared that her daughter has been sober for 90 days.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1080&h=540&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F11%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1080&h=540&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F11%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi", "November"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/demi-lovato-grateful-home-vote-after-rehab/", "title": "Demi Lovato Breaks Social Media Silence After Return from Rehab: 'So Grateful to Be Home'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Demi Lovato,News", "news_keywords": "Demi Lovato,News", "description": "PEOPLE confirmed on Sunday that Demi Lovato was out of rehab", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Demi Lovato Breaks Social Media Silence After Return from Rehab: 'So Grateful to Be Home'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/demi-lovato-grateful-home-vote-after-rehab/", "description": "PEOPLE confirmed on Sunday that Demi Lovato was out of rehab", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1080&h=540&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F11%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "width": 1080, "height": 540}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/music/demi-lovato-grateful-home-vote-after-rehab/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F11%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/music/demi-lovato-grateful-home-vote-after-rehab/", "title": "Demi Lovato Breaks Social Media Silence After Return from Rehab: 'So Grateful to Be Home'", "description": "PEOPLE confirmed on Sunday that Demi Lovato was out of rehab", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1080&h=540&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F11%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/music/demi-lovato-grateful-home-vote-after-rehab/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
