But after the latest Bachelor breakup to rock our worlds (Ben Higgins and Lauren Bushnell announced their decision to split just this week), we have one lingering question: Where do all the Bachelor rings go when the engagements are called off?\n\nChris Harris has some of the particulars\u2013and a few ideas of his own, too. \"[The rings] go to heaven,\" he quipped to ET. \"I really don't know, because obviously Neil Lane gives these rings, but I think we own the rings at a certain point. Well, not me. I'd be cashing in my diamonds and living in Hawaii.\" The Bachelor host did offer up a few concrete details along with his jokes. \"The rings that are given back go back to [the production company] Next Entertainment or whoever,\" he said. \"There is probably a vault or bucket of just rings.\"\n\nWhile a source told ET couples are only required to return the rings if they break up within two years of the finale, Harrison did shut down the idea of couples recycling their rings in future relationships. \"Here's the thing, what do you do with those rings? You don't want one,\" he said. \"You can't give it to the [next] girl you love, because that's a tainted ring and it obviously didn't work out. That's bad juju. So I don't know what you do with those rings. Maybe we sell them back to Neil Lane.\"", "images":
