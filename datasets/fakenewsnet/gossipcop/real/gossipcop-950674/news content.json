Markle hit the ground running with her royal engagements after her mid-May royal wedding, and by the looks of their fun giggles at recent events, she and Queen Elizabeth II get along famously.\n\nHowever, the major faux pas that the new Duchess committed at the Queen's Young Leader awards that made headlines was her crossing her legs over her knees instead of using the so-called \"Duchess Slant,\" which involves crossing her legs at the ankles instead of the knees. If that wasn't enough, though, now another supposed break in royal protocol has come to light. Markle attempted to reach for Prince Harry's hand as they walked behind the Queen.", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/42196c046e4a2503f7f937da1575ba1c?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nicole-scherzinger-2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fed4959c-fb17-4183-9a69-aa4c161aa162.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/7d29454b-301e-4088-86fa-3aff1cf25b9e.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-3.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mandy-Rose-3.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4964206/meghan-markle-pda-blunder-prince-harry/", "title": "Meghan Markle Makes A PDA Blunder With Prince Harry Amidst Roller Coaster Week", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meghan Markle Makes A PDA Blunder With Prince Harry Amidst Roller Coaster Week", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4964206/meghan-markle-pda-blunder-prince-harry/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Meghan Markle Makes A PDA Blunder With Prince Harry Amidst Roller Coaster Week", "image": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-3.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-08-20 08:51:48Z", "section": "Celebrities"}, "description": "Meghan Markle Makes A PDA Blunder With Prince Harry Amidst Roller Coaster Week", "keywords": "Celebrities", "news_keywords": "Celebrities", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1534755108.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
