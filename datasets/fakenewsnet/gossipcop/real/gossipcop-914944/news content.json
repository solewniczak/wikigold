The singer-songwriter\u2019s representatives did not immediately return EW\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my biggest joy in life to share my music with my fans all over the world, but I have to follow my doctors orders and undergo surgery to repair my torn ACL so I can get ready to give it all on my Summer tour and beyond,\u201d Kesha wrote on Instagram Tuesday, referencing an upcoming joint tour with her \u201cGood Old Days\u201d collaborator titled The Adventures of Kesha and Macklemore.\n\n\u201cMoving these dates is making me sick with sadness, but I tried to will this injury away and unfortunately it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Kesha\u2019s Instagram post continued. \u201cI love you all and I\u2019ll work every single day as hard as i can to recover and get back on stage as soon as possible. I\u2019m so sorry and sending love always.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-916465130-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F03%2F15%2FJoey-Nolfi.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-916465130-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-916465130-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joey Nolfi", "February", "At Am Est"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/music/2018/02/20/kesha-postpones-tour-dates-torn-acl-injury/", "title": "Kesha postpones spring tour dates ahead of surgery: 'I'm heartbroken'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Kesha,Macklemore", "news_keywords": "Kesha,Macklemore", "description": "Singer-songwriter will undergo surgery for an injury sustained while performing in Dubai.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Kesha postpones spring tour dates ahead of surgery: 'I'm heartbroken'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/music/2018/02/20/kesha-postpones-tour-dates-torn-acl-injury/", "description": "Singer-songwriter will undergo surgery for an injury sustained while performing in Dubai.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-916465130-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/music/2018/02/20/kesha-postpones-tour-dates-torn-acl-injury/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-916465130-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/music/2018/02/20/kesha-postpones-tour-dates-torn-acl-injury/", "title": "Kesha postpones spring tour dates ahead of surgery: 'I'm heartbroken'", "description": "Singer-songwriter will undergo surgery for an injury sustained while performing in Dubai.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-916465130-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/music/2018/02/20/kesha-postpones-tour-dates-torn-acl-injury/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519081200.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
