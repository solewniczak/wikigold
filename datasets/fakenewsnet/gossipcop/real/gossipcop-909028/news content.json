Kendrick Lamar's powerful performance may be the biggest moment of the night. #GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/ILJ3FHou9Q \u2014 iHeartRadio (@iHeartRadio) January 29, 2018\n\nBono and The Edge from U2 then came onto the stage as Lamar began performing \u201cDNA.\u201d\n\nChappelle then joined the trio on stage and said ?Hi. I?m Dave Chappelle. And I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America. Sorry for the interruption. Please continue.?\n\nW-O-W! What a grand opening to the 60th #GRAMMYs from @kendricklamar, @u2, and #DaveChappelle Now sit back and enjoy the show. pic.twitter.com/n7CGNiGYlE \u2014 Recording Academy (@RecordingAcad) January 29, 2018\n\nRELATED: Ryan Seacrest didn?t know what to do when this songstress suffered a wardrobe malfunction during an interview\n\nIn the next part of his performance, Lamar rapped with a solo drummer, and later his dancers returned wearing red hoodies. As Lamar rapped, each of the dancers fell to the ground as gunshot sounds played over the performance. A few minutes later, Lamar would take home the Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Performance for his song \u201cLoyalty,\u201d featuring Rihanna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch the entire performance below:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DuckworthTDE/status/957779395485323265", "images": ["https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/twitter_pop-culture-grammys-nip.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/themes/wom-rare-platform/assets/img/svg-menu/menu-user.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036336&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Veterans-Picnic-Hershel-Williams.jpg?w=409&h=225&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/gettyimages-kendrick-2018-grammys.jpg", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-design-5.jpg?w=409&h=225&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/themes/wom-rare-platform/assets/img/account.png", "https://rare.us/wp-content/themes/wom-rare-platform/assets/brands/rare/img/rare-logo.svg", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Untitled-design-4.jpg?w=409&h=225&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-E2kxRT9Lk59KK.gif", "https://rare.us/wp-content/themes/wom-rare-platform/assets/img/svg-menu/menu-page.svg", "https://rare.us/wp-content/themes/wom-rare-platform/assets/img/svg-menu/menu-discuss.svg"], "top_img": "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/gettyimages-kendrick-2018-grammys.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Former Rare Staff", "Emily Mack", "Haley Van Horn", "About The Author"], "canonical_link": "https://rare.us/people/kendrick-lamar-got-the-grammys-off-to-a-politically-charged-start-with-a-little-help-from-u2-and-dave-chappelle/", "title": "Kendrick Lamar got the Grammys off to a politically charged start with a little help from U2 and Dave Chappelle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "verification": "0c36d0e5789b8e86826ca3023cf53b44", "description": "\"I just want to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America.\"", "keywords": "all news, people, bono, dave chappelle, entertainment, grammys 2018, kendrick lamar, music, national anthem, people, politics, the edge, u2, us military", "fb": {"app_id": 2649681551948242}, "p": {"domain_verify": "c0809c6c9b1d4d37973dce032db72e5b"}, "msvalidate.01": "92EB67C1B2C34F1A8BF5E0B29F8840DE", "news_keywords": "all news, people, bono, dave chappelle, entertainment, grammys 2018, kendrick lamar, music, national anthem, people, politics, the edge, u2, us military", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 5.9.2", "rare": {"category_slug": "people", "category_name": "People"}, "FacebookShareMessage": "It didn't take long for the Grammy's to get political.", "TwitterShareMessage": "It didn't take long for the Grammy's to get political.", "og": {"site_name": "Rare", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://rare.us/people/kendrick-lamar-got-the-grammys-off-to-a-politically-charged-start-with-a-little-help-from-u2-and-dave-chappelle/", "title": "Kendrick Lamar got the Grammys off to a politically charged start with a little help from U2 and Dave Chappelle", "description": "\"I just want to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/gettyimages-kendrick-2018-grammys.jpg", "width": 616, "height": 322}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-29T01:08:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-29T01:12:44+00:00", "author": "https://rare.us/voices/former-rare-staff/", "section": "All News", "tag": "US military"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/cropped-cropped-mock-siteicon.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517188082.0, "source": "https://rare.us", "summary": ""}
