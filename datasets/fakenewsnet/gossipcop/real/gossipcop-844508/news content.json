Home, she told Entertainment Tonight, is \"the place that makes me happiest.\"\n\nJack Plunkett/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nSandy has two children \u2014 son Louis, 12, and daughter Laila, 10 \u2014 both of whom she adopted. Bryan has an adult daughter from a previous relationship.\n\n\"I take my job very seriously when I'm at work, and it's 24/7,\" Sandy said. \"I just want to be 24/7 with my babies and my family. We don't know how long or how short, but that's where I'm gonna be for a while.\"\n\nAs for what she plans to do during her time away from Hollywood? Be a mom.\n\nThe \"Miss Congeniality\" star plans on \"servicing [her children's] every need\" and managing \"their social calendar.\" She added, \"There are extra steps you have to take because we're still in a pandemic. All the parents know me as the crazy lady with the pandemic. They know their children will return without COVID when they've come to our house.\"\n\nEvan Agostini/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nSandra did let her kids mingle with her Hollywood pals at the premiere of her new film \"The Lost City\" on March 14.\n\n\"I've never had them come to a premiere,\" she said days before the premiere. \"They'll [come in through the] back door, although Laila really wants to be on the red carpet. That's not happening. They get to see it. They get to invite a friend. This will be the first time out of this sort of dark cloud of the pandemic that they get to feel some kind of normalcy.\"\n\nThey'll also get to see their mother show off her comedy chops and take leeches off Channing Tatum's backside.\n\n\"Channing is so comfortable with [himself],\" she said. \"He knew it was for a comedy, he wasn't trying to be serious. He worked really hard to make sure when his rear end turned into frame that it was perfect. I mean, I looked, I look for imperfections, and I did not see any.\"\n\nOf the \"Magic Mike\" star's butt, she laughed, \"It's very smooth. We didn't have to do any, like, visual effects fixes. It's just like a little baby's bottom.\"", "images": ["https://www.wonderwall.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/ww-logo.svg",
