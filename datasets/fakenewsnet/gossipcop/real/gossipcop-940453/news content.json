Not to mention, her clan of mostly-loyal best friends: Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte. (If you haven\u2019t decided which of the four girlfriends you\u2019re the most similar to, perhaps it\u2019s time to rewatch the series.)\n\nVIDEO: Sarah Jessica Parker Knows How to Do Sex and the City Without Kim Cattrall\n\nThe hit HBO show first aired on June 6, 1998 (yep, it\u2019s been 20 years!), and while critics didn\u2019t immediately fall head over heels with Bradshaw and her stories, the show's producers eventually found their footing, moving on to release six mega successful seasons plus two movie spinoffs.\n\nRELATED: You Won't believe These Early Reviews of Sex and the City Are Real\n\nWhich brings us to 2018. Indeed, Sarah Jessica Parker (Bradshaw), Cynthia Nixon (Miranda Hobbes), Kim Cattrall (Samantha Jones), and Kristin Davis (Charlotte York) have all moved on to live lives that don\u2019t include a weekly Sunday brunch plus glamorous trips to Abu Dhabi.

and yes, how they\u2019ve transformed.", "images":
