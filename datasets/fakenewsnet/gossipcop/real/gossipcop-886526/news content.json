Her most recent project? Serving as one of the executive producers for Netflix's 13 Reasons Why.\n\n\"I want [kids] to understand it,\" Gomez told The Hollywood Reporter of the hit Netflix series, also citing her 90-day hiatus from the spotlight. \"I would do anything to be able to have a good influence on this generation, but I definitely relate to everything that was going on. I was there for the last episode, and I was a mess just seeing it all come to life, because I've experienced that.\"\n\nIn September 2017, she revealed that part of her break included a kidney transplant \u2014 from her best friend \u2014 due to complications from her Lupus. Just after breaking the news, she was back to work, filming a new Woody Allen movie in N.Y.C.", "images":
