K thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reading some of your DMs and so many of you are like, \u2018Girl, you fine but like, eat some bread!\u2019 So I would like to put in a request for anyone who is concerned about my bread consumption to send to Wells Adams, because he is the sole person who knows about how much bread I consume on a daily basis. Thanks! Love you, mean it, k bye,\u201d she said in her Instagram Story.\n\nAnd Adams verified that Hyland loves bread, adding, \u201cJust saw Sarah\u2019s story. Apparently there are concerns about how much bread she eats. I can vouch for her that she truly is \u2014 she\u2019s not a carnivore, she\u2019s a carbivore.\u201d\n\n\"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" Broadway Opening, New York, USA - 22 Apr 2018 Sarah Hyland and Wells Adams | Credit: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had the greatest year. Maybe one day I\u2019ll talk about it but for now, I\u2019d like my privacy. I will say that this year has brought a lot of changes and with that, physical changes,\u201d Hyland wrote. \u201cI have been told that I can\u2019t work out. Which, for me, is very upsetting. I love to be STRONG \u2026 Strength is everything. Being strong has gotten me where I am. Both mentally and physically. I am not a fan of \u2018being skinny.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd despite fighting off the negative comments from critics, she\u2019s never been happier in her relationship with Adams, especially since moving in together in August.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F07%2Fsarah-hyland1-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1613&h=807&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fsarah-hyland-wells-adams-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1613&h=807&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fsarah-hyland-wells-adams-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi", "October"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/health/sarah-hyland-wells-adams-claps-back-troll-body-shame/", "title": "Wells Adams Defends Sarah Hyland Against Body-Shaming Troll", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Couples,Modern Family,Sarah Hyland,Wells Adams", "news_keywords": "Couples,Modern Family,Sarah Hyland,Wells Adams", "description": "Sarah Hyland, who suffers complications from her kidney dysplasia, showed off her figure in a bikini selfie", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Modern Family Star Sarah Hyland's Boyfriend Wells Adams Claps Back After Body-Shaming Troll Says 'Eat a Doughnut'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/health/sarah-hyland-wells-adams-claps-back-troll-body-shame/", "description": "Sarah Hyland, who suffers complications from her kidney dysplasia, showed off her figure in a bikini selfie", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1613&h=807&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fsarah-hyland-wells-adams-2000.jpg", "width": 1613, "height": 807}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/health/sarah-hyland-wells-adams-claps-back-troll-body-shame/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fsarah-hyland-wells-adams-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/health/sarah-hyland-wells-adams-claps-back-troll-body-shame/", "title": "Modern Family Star Sarah Hyland's Boyfriend Wells Adams Claps Back After Body-Shaming Troll Says 'Eat a Doughnut'", "description": "Sarah Hyland, who suffers complications from her kidney dysplasia, showed off her figure in a bikini selfie", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1613&h=807&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fsarah-hyland-wells-adams-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/health/sarah-hyland-wells-adams-claps-back-troll-body-shame/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
