In a new interview with Footwear News, the star covers the magazine and talks about her style evolution.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve seen me in the 1970s and \u201980s, you\u2019ll agree with me that my style has gotten better. But also that\u2019s more confidence too,\u201d she admits. \u201cI got more comfortable in dressing in the way I want to dress instead of what I think I\u2019m supposed to dress like. That\u2019s what is great about fashion. It should be your own unique, individual expression.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Ellen DeGeneres Confirms Stand-Up Special On Netflix: \u2018Okay I\u2019m In\u2019\n\nWhen talking about her style moments from the past, the one she\u2019s most proud of is of her most memorable, \u201cwearing the Bjork swan dress when I was hosting the Emmys in 2001.\u201d\n\nOutside of her style, DeGeneres finds influence from fellow women like Oprah and Michelle Obama. \u201cObviously Oprah. Where she came from and her life and what\u2019s she accomplished is pretty amazing. Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Rosa Parks and whoever the woman is who invented Spanx. We have to thank her,\u201d she jokes.\n\nRELATED: Colin Farrell Makes Ellen DeGeneres Laugh With Hilarious \u2018Retro Bush\u2019 Story\n\nOver the course of her career, the comedian has had countless career milestones she considers to be very important.\n\n\u201cThe Presidential Medal of Freedom is a pretty big deal, but also being the first woman on the show for Johnny Carson to call me over and to sit down. Getting married and marrying my wife was a big moment in my life. I\u2019m blessed with lots of answers to that question,\u201d she says.", "images": ["https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/global.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/162592_8754.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=90", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1384867282.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/royals-brick-340x150-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/ofy7npnbai-2nl2qwcfrt/ETC031522CelebEstateStallone.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/awards-banner-350x150.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/corus.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/162592_0054.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-454960293.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=82", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/degeneres.png?w=720&h=480&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/OTWAliceandMaster02.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/cj058gk7ve-j85qdlk7px/ETC031522TBTJulietteLewisBestRoles01.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/ad-choices.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/newsletter/newsletter-large.jpg", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/thumbnail_brick-340x150-1.jpeg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1354160954.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1238909632.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/3yzy074ydc-hdhxiluc50/A11_Ben_Affleck_JLo_Spain_and_Deep_Water.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/3l46mqci6d-epaiw19ua7/ETC0315TheLostCityPremiere.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60"], "top_img": "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/degeneres.png?w=720&h=480&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jordan Appugliesi"], "canonical_link": "https://etcanada.com/news/229365/ellen-degeneres-favourite-fashion-moment-was-the-bjork-swan-dress/", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 Favourite Fashion Moment Was The Bjork Swan Dress", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "x4SpOp2Us67I6MlQN2uFse9KXvwgu1d8_r5F2qkIbYc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 5.9.2", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 Favourite Fashion Moment Was The Bjork Swan Dress", "author": "Jordan Appugliesi", "description": "Ellen DeGeneres is known for many things like being a comedian, actress and, of course, the host of her own talk show, \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\".
