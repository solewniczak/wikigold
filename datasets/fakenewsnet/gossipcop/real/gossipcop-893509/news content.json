{"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/11/13/wonder-woman-2-star-wars/", "text": "Warner Bros. announced Monday that Wonder Woman 2 will debut six weeks earlier than originally planned \u2014 moving the hugely anticipated superhero sequel up to Nov. 1, 2019. The Patty Jenkins-directed film was set to be released on Dec. 13, 2019.\n\nThe first Wonder Woman delivered $400 million domestically this summer and topped the box office for its first two weeks of release. If its sequel was released Dec. 13 next year as had been planned, it would be almost certainly struck down to the chart\u2019s second position one week later by Episode IX. Opening the film earlier gives it plenty of runway to potentially continue dominating before the J.J. Abrams-directed Star Wars sequel storms theaters.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fwonderwoman-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F11%2F11%2Fjames-hibberd-image.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fwonderwoman-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Hibberd", "November", "At Pm Est"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/11/13/wonder-woman-2-star-wars/", "title": "Wonder Woman 2 gets new release date away from Star Wars", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Gal Gadot", "news_keywords": "Gal Gadot", "description": "Wonder Woman 2 gets earlier release date, away from\u00a0Star Wars", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "'Wonder Woman 2' gets earlier release date, away from\u00a0'Star Wars: Episode IX'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/11/13/wonder-woman-2-star-wars/", "description": "Wonder Woman 2 gets earlier release date, away from\u00a0Star Wars", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fwonderwoman-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/11/13/wonder-woman-2-star-wars/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fwonderwoman-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/11/13/wonder-woman-2-star-wars/", "title": "'Wonder Woman 2' gets earlier release date, away from\u00a0'Star Wars: Episode IX'", "description": "Wonder Woman 2 gets earlier release date, away from\u00a0Star Wars", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fwonderwoman-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/11/13/wonder-woman-2-star-wars/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510527600.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
