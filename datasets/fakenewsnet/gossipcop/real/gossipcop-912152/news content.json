Watch the first footage from the live-action Kim Possible movie\n\nKim Possible type TV Show network Disney Channel genre Animated\n\nAdventure\n\n\u201cWho am I? I\u2019m Kim Possible.\u201d\n\nDisney Channel released a trailer Friday featuring the first footage from their upcoming live-action TV movie version of Kim Possible.\n\nSadie Stanley stars in the movie as the eponymous red-headed teenager and Alyson Hannigan plays Kim\u2019s mom. Christy Carlson Romano and Patton Oswalt have both signed on as well. Romano voiced the title character in the original animated Kim Possible series, while Oswalt voiced super villain Professor Dementor. We don\u2019t know what roles the two will play in the movie, but we do know who Kim will be facing off against: mad scientist Dr. Drakken (Todd Stashwick) and his sarcastic partner in crime, Shego (Taylor Ortega).\n\nkim-possible-split-2 Animated Kim Possible and Sadie Stanley as Kim Possible | Credit: Courtesy Disney; Disney Channel/Craig Sjodin\n\nIn November, EW exclusively revealed the first photos of Stashwick and Ortega in character.\n\nKim-Possible-2 Credit: Disney Channel (2)\n\nCo-director Adam B. Stein and Zach Lipovsky told EW at the time that they ultimately decided to forgo animated Drakken\u2019s signature blue skin in favor of creating a character that is more grounded and less, well, cartoony.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s got a blue infection within,\u201d Lipovsky said of the new Drakken. \u201cIt\u2019s like some experiment or some dastardly plan went wrong years ago and now he\u2019s got this side effect where he\u2019s got a bluish hue.\u201d\n\nThe live-action Kim Possible movie will premiere in 2019. Immediately following Kim Possible, Disney Channel will present a first look at the new eight-part miniseries Fast Layne. The miniseries will move to its regular timeslot with a second installment on Feb. 17 at 8 p.m.\n\nRelated content:", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F12%2Fkim-possible-21-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F03%2F14%2Fpgomezheadshot.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F07%2Fkim-possible-split-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F07%2Fkim-possible-split-2-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F07%2Fkim-possible-split-2-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patrick Gomez", "December", "At Am Est"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/12/07/kim-possible-live-action-movie-trailer/", "title": "What's the sitch?
