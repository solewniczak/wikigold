Life breaks free. Life finds a way,\" Goldblum's Malcolm says in the trailer.\n\nThe film is scheduled for release on June 22, 2018.", "images": ["https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3581512702116/2017/i/15127026824432/v1.5/Dinosaurs-face-extinction-again-in-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom-trailer.jpg?lg=2"], "top_img": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3581512702116/2017/i/15127026824432/v1.5/Dinosaurs-face-extinction-again-in-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom-trailer.jpg?lg=2", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ray Downs"], "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Movies/2017/12/07/Dinosaurs-face-extinction-again-in-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom-trailer/3581512702116/", "title": "Dinosaurs face extinction again in 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' trailer", "meta_data": {"description": "The trailer for 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' was released Thursday.", "keywords": "Entertainment, Movies, Bryce Dallas Howard, Chris Pratt, Jeff Goldblum", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Movies, Bryce Dallas Howard, Chris Pratt, Jeff Goldblum", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "The trailer for 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' was released Thursday.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Movies/2017/12/07/Dinosaurs-face-extinction-again-in-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom-trailer/3581512702116/", "title": "Dinosaurs face extinction again in 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' trailer", "type": "article", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3581512702116/2017/i/15127026824432/v1.5/Dinosaurs-face-extinction-again-in-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom-trailer.jpg?lg=2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPI", "title": "Dinosaurs face extinction again in 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' trailer", "description": "The trailer for 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' was released Thursday.", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3581512702116/2017/i/15127026824432/v2.1/Dinosaurs-face-extinction-again-in-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom-trailer.jpg?lg=4"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.upi.com", "summary": ""}
