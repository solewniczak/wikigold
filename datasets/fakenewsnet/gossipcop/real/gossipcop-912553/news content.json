Fans voted Graham back in before the finale, during which he faced off in head-to-head battles with competitors Leah Jenae, Whitney Reign, and Sharaya J, besting all three to finish out the season on top.\n\n\u201cWhen Diddy said my name, I looked at him for four seconds like, \u2018Really?'\u201d Graham tells EW.\n\nThe rap magnate \u2014 one of three judges alongside DJ Khaled and Meghan Trainor \u2014 gave Graham a record contract with Republic Records, which will come with career guidance from the panel. Graham also earned the title of iHeart Radio\u2019s \u201cOn the Verge\u201d artist.\n\n\u201cThe reaction\u2019s been incredible,\u201d he says, confessing that he felt insecure about coming from the U.K. to compete against American artists. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure how Americans would be, whether they were going to be like, \u2018Nah, go home.'\u201d\n\nLuckily for Graham, The Four fans had an opposite reaction, with many rallying as #TeamJames on Twitter to support him through the competition.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Ft4-208_rm_0218_hires2-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Ft4-208_rm_0218_hires2-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Isaac Feldberg", "August", "At Pm Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/02/the-four-winner-james-graham-finale-learning-mistakes/", "title": "The Four winner James Graham talks the finale, learning from his mistakes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "After coming out on top in season 2 of 'The Four,' Graham sat down with EW to talk about his surprise victory.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "'The Four' winner talks the finale, learning from mistakes", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/02/the-four-winner-james-graham-finale-learning-mistakes/", "description": "After coming out on top in season 2 of 'The Four,' Graham sat down with EW to talk about his surprise victory.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Ft4-208_rm_0218_hires2-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/02/the-four-winner-james-graham-finale-learning-mistakes/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Ft4-208_rm_0218_hires2-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/02/the-four-winner-james-graham-finale-learning-mistakes/", "title": "'The Four' winner talks the finale, learning from mistakes", "description": "After coming out on top in season 2 of 'The Four,' Graham sat down with EW to talk about his surprise victory.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Ft4-208_rm_0218_hires2-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/02/the-four-winner-james-graham-finale-learning-mistakes/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533160800.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
