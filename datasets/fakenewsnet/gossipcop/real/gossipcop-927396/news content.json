According to a source who spoke to E! News, the newlyweds ended up in the one place where Harry apparently \u201cfeels like he can be himself\u201d: Africa.\n\nEarlier this month, the couple apparently visited more than two countries in East Africa, where they went on safaris, participated in \u201coutdoor adventures,\u201d and did a whole lot of relaxing.\n\n\u201cIt was the perfect break and blend of their passions,\u201d the source told E! News. \u201cRestorative and the perfect holiday before starting a very busy second half of 2018.\u201d\n\nMonths before the royal wedding on May 19, the British tabloids were convinced that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were going to honeymoon in Namibia, Africa. Mere days after the ceremony, though, E! News refuted that rumor. Then, there was the speculation that the couple would jet to the beachside town of Noosa in Queensland, Australia, which was challenged one day later by a TMZ report that named Alberta, Canada, as the royal honeymoon spot.\n\nIt looks like Royal expert Omid Scobie was right all along. In late May, he told Elle, \u201cThe couple have been keen to explore other countries in Africa, and I\u2019m certain we will see them do that on this honeymoon.\u201d", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/15f/927/26c056f70202fb3184a1a4114542d469a6-13-prince-harry-meghan.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/15f/927/26c056f70202fb3184a1a4114542d469a6-13-prince-harry-meghan.rsquare.w330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/3e3/78c/0fc995d8170a6d7ce375f50f08231f83be-social-0622Cov4x5-Ukraine.w240.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/15f/927/26c056f70202fb3184a1a4114542d469a6-13-prince-harry-meghan.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amanda Arnold"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/06/prince-harry-meghan-markle-honeymoon-in-africa-report.html", "title": "Prince Harry, Meghan Markle Honeymoon in Africa: Report", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Do We Finally Know Where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Honeymooned?", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/06/prince-harry-meghan-markle-honeymoon-in-africa-report.html", "description": "The location would make sense for them.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/15f/927/26c056f70202fb3184a1a4114542d469a6-13-prince-harry-meghan.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Is This Where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Honeymooned?", "description": "The location would make sense for them.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/15f/927/26c056f70202fb3184a1a4114542d469a6-13-prince-harry-meghan.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@aMandolinz", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-13T20:02:22.678-04:00", "tag": "culture, royals, celebrity, honeymoons, royal wedding 2.0", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle reportedly went to East Africa for their honeymoon, during which they visited at least two countries.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "culture, royals, celebrity, honeymoons, royal wedding 2.0", "author": "Amanda Arnold", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528934542.678, "source": "https://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
