They went on to achieve great success in their home country, selling hundreds of thousands of albums and singles.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, they broke the Japanese market and went on to become one of the most successful South Korean acts in the country: the Japanese-language version of their single Replay sold more than 100,000 copies there.\n\nNews of Kim\u2019s death prompted a flurry of messages on social media, with many fans voicing disbelief.\n\nA Twitter account devoted to K-pop photos said: \u201cSending our deepest condolences to SHINee Jonghyun and those who known him well. If you\u2019re going through a hard time, please do know that you never walk alone. Talk to someone and take care of yourself.\u201d\n\nAnother Twitter user wrote: \u201cToday we lost one of the most talented artists in Korea. I\u2019m heartbroken and devastated by the news.\u201d\n\nPolice arrived at Kim\u2019s apartment after receiving an emergency call from his sister, according to South Korean media. The singer was taken to a nearby hospital and was later pronounced dead, police said.\n\nThe Yonhap agency reported that Kim\u2019s sister had received a text message from her brother shortly before his death that read: \u201cPlease let me go. Tell me I did well. Final farewell.\u201d\n\nThe five-member boyband, with Kim as their main vocalist, released their debut album, The SHINee World, in 2008. They have since released five more Korean albums and another five aimed at the Japanese market \u2013 the most recent in January this year. All of their Korean albums except their debut have topped the charts in their home country.\n\nSHINee are considered among the best live performers in K-pop and have won multiple awards for their complex dance routines. They have also become known for setting trends in South Korea \u2013 including popularising skinny jeans. The group are frequently referred to by the moniker \u201cthe princes of K-pop\u201d.\n\nKim also had a successful career as a solo singer-songwriter. He released three records: an album called She Is in 2016, which topped the Korean charts, and two compilations in 2015 and 2017. In 2015, he released a book called Skeleton Flower, which detailed the stories behind his songs. In 2010, along with other major Korean artists, he contributed vocals to Let\u2019s Go, a campaign song for the G20 summit, which was held in Seoul.\n\nThroughout his career he collaborated with numerous other Korean artists and also hosted his own radio show on the Korean station MBC.\n\nKim last appeared in public at a solo concert in Seoul this month.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=K-pop%2CSouth+Korea%2CWorld+news%2CAsia+Pacific%2CMusic%2CCulture%2CPop+and+rock", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3a72608df8816d8d5b66856be310c0b15faa01c/0_296_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=465&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=c72f029dd305f14612e98e722600e4d0", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ef36555c9e2f37c8fd96c9720febd35b4f2f8a8/0_28_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a055cf2a6d2a9818ab788857ed6b88d1"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ef36555c9e2f37c8fd96c9720febd35b4f2f8a8/0_28_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a055cf2a6d2a9818ab788857ed6b88d1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Justin Mccurry", "Rachel Aroesti"], "canonical_link": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/shinee-kim-jong-hyun-lead-singer-of-south-korean-boy-band-dies", "title": "Lead singer of South Korean boyband SHINee dies", "meta_data": {"description": "News reports say Kim Jong-hyun, 27, was unconscious when taken to hospital and suggest cause of death was suicide", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/shinee-kim-jong-hyun-lead-singer-of-south-korean-boy-band-dies", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ef36555c9e2f37c8fd96c9720febd35b4f2f8a8/0_28_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a055cf2a6d2a9818ab788857ed6b88d1", "description": "News reports say Kim Jong-hyun, 27, was unconscious when taken to hospital and suggest cause of death was suicide", "type": "article", "title": "Lead singer of South Korean boyband SHINee dies", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/justinmccurry,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rachel-aroesti", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Music", "published_time": "2017-12-18T14:08:37.000Z", "tag": "K-pop,South Korea,World news,Asia Pacific,Music,Culture,Pop and rock", "modified_time": "2018-03-27T10:47:17.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2017/dec/18/shinee-kim-jong-hyun-lead-singer-of-south-korean-boy-band-dies?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2017/dec/18/shinee-kim-jong-hyun-lead-singer-of-south-korean-boy-band-dies?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/shinee-kim-jong-hyun-lead-singer-of-south-korean-boy-band-dies", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2017/dec/18/shinee-kim-jong-hyun-lead-singer-of-south-korean-boy-band-dies?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ef36555c9e2f37c8fd96c9720febd35b4f2f8a8/0_28_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&s=51266665166639f4c0f0484ac075cf6a", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513551600.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
