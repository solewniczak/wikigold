But inside the Beacon Theater on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side, a fire blazed. The faithful had gathered. A religious ceremony was to take place. Six deities waited in the wings, but they needn\u2019t proselytize upon taking the stage. Every sane soul had already kneeled at their altar, and would do so again for several years to come.\n\nThe event, of course, was VH1\u2032s \u201cDivas Live.\u201d The gods were pop prima donnas: Aretha Franklin, Mariah Carey, C\u00e9line Dion, Gloria Estefan, Shania Twain and Carole King who, separately and together, performed numbers from their respective catalogs. The worship service was a ratings smash, so the following year, VH1 increased the cause for hosannas. Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, Cher and Brandy headlined \u201cDivas Live \u201999,\u201d joined by Mary J. Blige, Chaka Khan, LeAnn Rimes, Faith Hill and \u201cvery special guest\u201d Elton John. It became the highest-rated program in the network\u2019s history, a grail for both VH1 and the world at large.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs almost any large-scale production can attest, putting at least half a dozen superstars on the same bill doesn\u2019t happen without a few hitches \u2015 and altercations \u2015 along the way. So, ahead of the event\u2019s 20th anniversary, I called up five producers who put together the first three \u201cDivas\u201d shows (2000\u2032s was a Diana Ross tribute featuring Carey, Hill, Donna Summer, Destiny\u2019s Child and RuPaul) to see just how much gossip I could marshal about these glittery exaltations.\n\nGrab some popcorn. Or a little holy water.\n\nGloria Estefan, Mariah Carey, Aretha Franlin, Carole King, C\u00e9line Dion and Shania Twain perform at \"Divas Live\" 20 years ago. KMazur via Getty Images\n\n1. The Origins, Or: On The First Day, God Created C\u00e9line\n\nHeading into 1998, a VH1 executive by the name of Wayne Isaak, who\u2019d spent more than a decade as a publicity guru at A&M Records, was courting C\u00e9line Dion for a \u201cbig concert event\u201d that would appeal to the network\u2019s core audience: adults 24 to 35, particularly women, who\u2019d made insidery fodder like \u201cBehind the Music,\u201d \u201cStorytellers\u201d and \u201cCrossroads\u201d appointment viewing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround the same time, Isaak and the rest of VH1\u2032s original-programming team was in need of a tentpole to replace the network\u2019s eponymous Honors special, a lackluster ceremony that, between 1994 and 1997, saluted musicians\u2019 philanthropic work. Conveniently, the network had just launched the Save the Music Foundation, a nonprofit that donated instruments to public schools. Top brass seized the opportunity to raise funds for the organization and stage an all-star revue.\n\nIsaak knew he could get Dion, but Lauren Zalaznick, a former marketing whiz who would go on to run Bravo, pushed for a franchise that would serve as a brand unto itself. So Isaak pitched an idea called \u201cThree Divas,\u201d a twist on the popular opera group known as the Three Tenors. The team thought to capitalize on the banner moment that women in music were enjoying. Sarah McLachlan had recently inaugurated Lilith Fair. Missy Elliott and Lil\u2019 Kim were eating up the hip-hop scene. At the female singer-songwriter apex sat figures like Alanis Morissette and Tori Amos. Madonna and Lauryn Hill were on the cusp of releasing career-defining records. The 1999 Grammys would boast a rare all-female Album of the Year roster.\n\nIsaak pitched Dion on the idea of joining Aretha Franklin and Mariah Carey for \u201cThree Divas,\u201d to which she apparently gave her resounding approval. With that, the concept quickly snowballed. What if we add Gloria Estefan, Isaak asked. \u201cOf course,\u201d everyone responded. And how about Shania Twain? Well, that was a bit iffier.\n\nTwain had a couple of modest pop hits to her name, but she was still predominately a country draw. With her third album, \u201cCome On Over,\u201d released to widespread acclaim in November 1997, her record label was working to turn her into a mainstream crossover virtuoso \u2015 a prospect aided by VH1, which put Twain\u2019s videos in frequent rotation. But she wasn\u2019t quite there yet when Isaak tried to convince his colleagues to place her in the same lineup as Franklin, Carey, Dion and Estefan.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want Shania Twain,\u201d Zalaznick recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she fit the bill as a diva. But he really convinced me that she was going to be the biggest artist of the year that year, and I think he was right.\u201d\n\nBy the time \u201cDivas Live\u201d aired in April, Isaak\u2019s premonition had come true. \u201cYou\u2019re Still the One\u201d was a mega-smash, turning Twain into a household name and giving her the third most popular song of 1998, per Billboard\u2019s year-end chart. In fact, Twain\u2019s segment was the highest-rated quarter-hour of the entire \u201cDivas\u201d broadcast, according to Isaak.\n\nOnce the lineup was intact \u2015 veteran producer Ken Ehrlich recruited Carole King as a last-minute elder-stateswoman addition \u2015 \u201cThree Divas\u201d shifted to \u201cDivas Live.\u201d As presented in the marketing, the women were on equal footing: The poster was designed so that each singer\u2019s head was exactly the same size, down to a millimeter, according to Zalaznick. That helped to curb managers\u2019 hesitations about the word \u201cdiva,\u201d a moniker the producers insisted was meant to be empowering. \u201cWe guaranteed them we\u2019d be friendly, that we wouldn\u2019t be too acerbic or make fun of them,\u201d Isaak said.\n\nAs such, a genre-agnostic jamboree was born. \u201cIn a weird way, we predated the casting of \u2018The Voice,\u2019 only in the sense that we were trying to take from each of the biggest genres, which was risky because, like the Grammys, if it\u2019s a show for absolutely everybody sometimes you run the risk that it\u2019s a show for nobody,\u201d Zalaznick said. \u201cWe decided it was our best shot at being the most appealing, with the most chances for amazing duets.\u201d\n\nMariah Carey and Aretha Franklin at \"Divas Live.\" Jack Vartoogian/Getty Images via Getty Images\n\n2. Lights, Cameras, Drama!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll the producers I spoke to agree that piecing together the first \u201cDivas\u201d slate was a cinch. But staging the actual show, which business honcho Jay Peterson estimates cost a hefty $2 million, proved more exhaustive.\n\nWhich is to say: Configuring six different artists\u2019 accouterments was demanding. Rehearsals were a bitch. Each singer \u2015 none of whom got paid for her appearance \u2015 brought her own band, so the set had to be taken apart during commercial breaks. Personal assistants and publicists were flocking throughout the Beacon Theater during the few days before the telecast; Carey\u2019s gofer stayed by her side, holding a bottle of Evian in one hand and a box of tissues in the other, according to Sean Murphy, a producer tasked with sorting out the \u201cnuts and bolts\u201d of the broadcast.\n\nIn addition to everyone\u2019s solo performance, Carey joined Franklin\u2019s set for \u201cChain of Fools,\u201d and Dion, Estefan and Twain joined King for a tender \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend\u201d collaboration, during which they sat around King\u2019s piano as if conjuring a modern-day \u201cKumbaya.\u201d\n\nThe production built toward a grand finale that united all the ladies, essentially leaving them to out-belt one another. They performed \u201d(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\u201d and the gospel anthem \u201cTestimony,\u201d a spectacle better described as Aretha Franklin and her five backup singers. Dion, a freshly minted icon thanks to the recent phenomenon that was \u201cMy Heart Will Go On,\u201d was the only one who had the chutzpah to try to eclipse Franklin, and it\u2019s a phenomenon to behold.\n\nPreparing the pageant to go live was, in no short order, hectic \u2015 especially by the time Franklin (\u201cMiss Franklin,\u201d as she apparently insisted everyone call her) stormed offstage and threatened not to return.\n\nEvery producer I spoke to related this incredible anecdote, to the point where \u201cI assume you\u2019ve heard the Aretha story\u201d became a common refrain. There\u2019s some dispute as to whether the episode occurred on the day of the show or the day before. Either way, Franklin, who\u2019d taken a bus from Detroit because she famously refuses to fly, had arrived for rehearsals with a firm dictum, via her management: Turn off the building\u2019s air conditioning when Aretha performs; it\u2019s not good for her vocal chords. \u201c\u2018Miss Franklin must have the air conditioning off,\u2019\u201d Zalaznick said, reciting the mandate she and her cohort consistently heard.\n\nBut when Franklin stepped onstage, she stopped in her tracks. \u201cPlease, everybody be quiet,\u201d she commanded, according to Isaak. Holding her hand up to a vent, Franklin realized the AC was indeed running. \u201cShe threw a hissy fit and walked out of the backstage into a car and left,\u201d Isaak said.\n\nAccounts vary as to why Franklin\u2019s ventilation request wasn\u2019t granted. According to Murphy\u2019s telling, the Beacon Theater just so happened to be testing the air-conditioning system that day. From Zalaznick\u2019s perspective, the AC actually was off and the room had turned into a sauna \u2015 \u201cthe other performers were horrified\u201d by the temperature, she recalled \u2015 by the time Franklin stormed away. Regardless, no one was sure whether Franklin would be back for the live show. Frantic phone calls ensued. People licked their fingers and held them in the air, looking for encroaching drafts. Eventually, the producers were informed that Franklin had gone to her hotel and was being fitted for dresses, a sign that she would, in fact, perform as scheduled.\n\n\u201cThings were coming down from Mount Sinai,\u201d Zalaznick joked. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know [if she\u2019d return], and then all of a sudden the clouds parted, the tablets were delivered, and suddenly we knew. To me, it felt that mysterious and insane.\u201d\n\nBut there was still one problem. \u201cShe\u2019s eating powdered donuts, and she\u2019s getting powdered sugar all over the dresses,\u201d the show\u2019s stylist, Cary Fetman, who was fitting Franklin, apparently told Murphy. (Representatives for Franklin did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)\n\nPowered sugar or not, Franklin did, of course, turn up, bringing down the house in what became a de facto tribute to her decades-long tenure. While introducing Carey for \u201cChain of Fools,\u201d she even landed a possible dig about the debacle: \u201cNow, a little earlier in the evening, we didn\u2019t get a chance to rehearse, so my newest girlfriend came in my trailer, and we sat in the back and we talked a little girl talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we put the house AC on and froze it as best we could,\u201d Zalaznick said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you I believe that we cut the AC before Aretha Franklin came out to perform, and maybe again for the finale. Or maybe we said we did but we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBrandy, Faith Hill, Chaka Khan, Whitney Houston, Mary J. Blige and LeAnn Rimes at \"Divas Live '99.\" Jack Vartoogian/Getty Images via Getty Images\n\n3. Bigger Wheels Keep On Turnin\u2019\n\nBy April 15, 1998, a franchise was born. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like: It\u2019s America \u2015 you\u2019ve got to do more,\u201d Isaak said. Zalaznick agreed: \u201cWe went crazy,\u201d she said of 1999\u2032s edition. Jeff Gaspin, a well-appointed producer who had green-lighted \u201cPop-Up Video,\u201d doubled down: \u201cI think we were booking any female artist who had presence. It became about quantity at that point.\u201d\n\nTo plan the second go-round, producers started with the \u201cMount Rushmore\u201d of contemporary divas: Tina Turner signed on first (after some initial hesitancy because she wasn\u2019t touring at the moment), and Whitney Houston, Cher and Brandy quickly followed as co-headliners, with Houston, who was in the midst of a musical renaissance, serving as the show\u2019s \u201canchor,\u201d much as Franklin had the previous year. The only major diva VH1 didn\u2019t manage to get, according to the producers\u2019 collective recollection, was Madonna, who\u2019d been a key player at the flashy 1998 VH1 Fashion Awards, where she received a tribute prize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo whose idea was that \u2018Divas\u2019 thing,\u201d Madonna apparently asked Isaak while prepping for the Fashion Awards at her home. When he admitted responsibility, \u201cshe just turned away with a repulsive sort of look,\u201d he said. So Isaak knew better than to \u201cbeg\u201d Madonna\u2019s management, just like he knew better than to ask Sheryl Crow, who at the time didn\u2019t want to be held in any sort of \u201cdiva\u201d regard. (Crow was more of a Lilith Fair queen.)\n\nToday, Zalaznick has regrets. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have Madonna? Heresy!\u201d she said. \u201cWhat was I thinking?\u201d\n\nOnce the \u201cyounger\u201d divas \u2015 LeAnn Rimes, Faith Hill and Mary J. Blige (as well as Chaka Khan and Elton John) \u2015 were added to the slate, the producers opted to stuff the presentation with sizzling duos and trios. John and Turner performed \u201cThe Bitch Is Back\u201d (a John song that Turner had covered in 1978), after which Cher joined them for \u201cProud Mary.\u201d Rimes united with John for \u201cWritten in the Stars,\u201d their hit single from the musical \u201cAida.\u201d Brandy and Hill teamed up for the former\u2019s cover of Bryan Adams\u2019 melodramatic \u201d(Everything I Do) I Do It For You.\u201d Houston welcomed her pal Blige for \u201cAin\u2019t No Way,\u201d and her daughter, Bobbi Kristina, sat onstage and recited a few lines on \u201cMy Love Is Your Love.\u201d Brandy, Hill, Blige and Rimes joined Houston and Kahn for \u201cI\u2019m Every Woman,\u201d a finale spectacle better described as Whitney Houston and her five backup singers.\n\nBut collaborations can be complicated things. For example, did you know Elton John and Tina Turner were arranging a joint tour, until a fallout during \u201cDivas Live\u201d rehearsals changed those plans? That\u2019s another saga that every producer remembers.\n\nWhile running through \u201cThe Bitch Is Back\u201d and \u201cProud Mary,\u201d with Turner centerstage at the microphone and John sitting at a piano upstage, Turner offered some notes on John\u2019s instrumentals. As the story goes, the two went back and forth, with Turner asking him to play \u201cProud Mary\u201d differently. \u201cHe gets up and slaps the piano and goes, \u2018I am not just some fucking piano player\u2019 and storms offstage,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cHe had to be talked down off the ledge. That took about half a day. He was pissed. We\u2019d done other shows with Elton John, and you always wonder: Are we going to get the good Elton or the bad Elton? He\u2019s very mercurial. He was in a snit that day, so when Tina started talking to him like he was just an accompanist, he lost his shit.\u201d\n\nEventually, Turner went to John\u2019s trailer. Exactly what went on inside is anyone\u2019s guess, but soon enough the trailer door opened and the duo returned to the theater. The show would go on. John apologized to the crew, according to Murphy, but in the interim, he and Turner had nixed the tour they were planning to announce after \u201cDivas Live.\u201d Turner addressed the incident during a CBS interview in 2000: \u201cI made a mistake when I needed to show him how to play \u2018Proud Mary.\u2019 The mistake is you don\u2019t show Elton John how to play his piano.\u201d (A representative for John did not respond to our request for comment.)\n\nRewatching the performance today knowing the duo was rebounding from an altercation, Turner and John\u2019s acumen is masterful. There\u2019s no indication they\u2019d ever quarreled. John mostly yields the stage to Turner \u2015 he wasn\u2019t a headliner, after all \u2015 and kisses her hand at the end, a sendoff for the ages.\n\nFeuds be damned, the ratings were dynamite. Disciples had flocked to witness their priestesses\u2019 sermons. After 1998\u2032s \u201cDivas Live\u201d had become the highest-rated program in the network\u2019s history, 1999\u2032s broke that record, netting a reported 2.4 million eyeballs on premiere night.\n\nFaith Hill, Diana Ross and Mariah Carey at \"VH1 Divas 2000: A Tribute to Diana Ross.\" Frank Micelotta Archive via Getty Images\n\n4. The Rest Is History\n\nBy 2000, VH1 had branded \u201cDivas\u201d successfully enough to break slightly from its hodgepodge format, turning the third iteration into an official Diana Ross tribute. Immediately, the event lost some of its pizazz. The producers nixed the live broadcast, which proved to be a blessing because it took a taxing five and a half hours to tape, partly because Ross (referred to specifically as \u201cMiss Ross,\u201d per her mandate) took 20 minutes to change costumes between each number, according to Murphy. Fed-up audience members started leaving. The telecast scaled back on collaborations \u2015 the highlight was Carey and Ross, who sailed through \u201cBaby Love\u201d and \u201cStop! In The Name Of Love\u201d \u2015 and squandered its fount of religious blessings.\n\nThe producers generally agree the Ross salute was a logistical mess. Ross had requested a sound system that proved glitchy, and she walked through the audience mid-performance, even though the cameras and lights weren\u2019t configured for such mobility. Regardless, the ratings remained impressive. Producers resoundingly agree that Donna Summer and Faith Hill were a delight to work with. Meanwhile, Destiny\u2019s Child, still a year away from releasing \u201cSurvivor,\u201d was thrilled just to be included. (It\u2019s nice to hear some pleasant gossip every now and then!) \u201cDestiny\u2019s Child did the show, and they were so excited to do it that Beyonc\u00e9 told me, \u2018We\u2019ve been rehearsing in our hotel room for the last two weeks,\u2019\u201d Isaak said. \u201cThat was the secret sauce: to get people to do something they\u2019re really into.\u201d\n\nFrom there, some of the \u201cDivas Live\u201d mojo waned. 2001 was an Aretha Franklin tribute \u2015 been there, done that \u2015 and subsequent years featured folks who were decidedly not divas: Kid Rock, Backstreet Boys, Bobby Brown. Still, the franchise managed to maintain the delicious team-ups: Dixie Chicks and Stevie Nicks doing \u201cLandslide,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 and Jewel rolling through \u201cProud Mary,\u201d Patti LaBelle joining Jessica Simpson and Cyndi Lauper for \u201cLady Marmalade.\u201d\n\n\u201cDivas\u201d ran consecutively through 2004, then took a break until 2009, when the lineup gravitated less toward classic chanteuses and more toward contemporary hitmakers. Between 2009 and 2012, Adele, Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Miley Cyrus, Nicki Minaj, Sugarland, Florence Welch and Ciara were among the headliners. And while nothing could recapture the magic of first two \u201cDivas\u201d renditions, in the post-Lilith Fair era it remained one of the few destinations for A-list women converging for a diverse musical extravaganza. (\u201cDivas\u201d returned in 2016 for a holiday special starring Mariah Carey, Chaka Khan, Vanessa Williams, Patti LaBelle and Teyana Taylor.)\n\nFurthermore, today\u2019s overstuffed pop-culture landscape can\u2019t turn an event like \u201cDivas Live\u201d into the miracle it was in the \u201990s: Artists don\u2019t rely as heavily on televised promotional appearances, and a network like VH1 can\u2019t sink millions of dollars on broadcasts that aren\u2019t guaranteed to generate exemplary ratings.\n\n\u201cThese things are lost to history sometimes,\u201d Zalaznick said. \u201cThe straightest and the most long-standing remain in the historical canon, but not these types of experiences, which have incredible value for many, many reasons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement", "images":
