Since then he has faced mounting criticism including from celebrities and parents for sharing the footage with his young following.\n\nOne UK mother, whose husband took his own life, has called on the YouTuber to meet with families affected by suicide after her 13-year-old son saw the video.\n\nMr Paul has now released a second apology after the first he offered on Twitter yesterday was criticised, including by Game of Thrones actress Sophie Turner, who called it \"self-praising\".", "images": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/generic/Matt-cartoon-255x206px-small.png", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/01/03/Logan-Paul-Twitter-apology_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqSHbwjXwQFTHXC82JPxmrX_6Vm4soJX9-iLE8hFCwcmo.PNG?impolicy=logo-overlay", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2022/03/16/TELEMMGLPICT000289612676_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcGmb0Cq1AKebopTsmihfZ0YMapKPjdhyLnv9ax6_too.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2022/03/13/TELEMMGLPICT000289276472_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8L7dzPEZE2x2_Qndk1smb8ntuk36qLwtF06MMO_4Cfg.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/01/02/TELEMMGLPICT000150282922_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.jpeg?imwidth=480", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2022/03/15/TELEMMGLPICT000289393182_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVioNkw4lP6e3VYTCBD-HsFHmPOpeFd0SyQx9dn7kM_w.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/01/03/Logan-Paul-Twitter-apology_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqSHbwjXwQFTHXC82JPxmrX_6Vm4soJX9-iLE8hFCwcmo.PNG?imwidth=680", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2022/03/16/TELEMMGLPICT000000287168484_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1mIGeVZn2oQvYvk17xwClAq_3ycdJwBhbEgDkahtgxw.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2022/03/16/TELEMMGLPICT000289611116_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqeoMPseA8rXxS7fV2a1a45dkLPhYWw13oNvoAQm_V3LM.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2022/03/16/TELEMMGLPICT000000289558939_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8juO8C_Vdx2cT20LARTibnFLfv0ucAwTrkjYdq767p4.jpeg?imwidth=350"], "top_img": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/01/03/Logan-Paul-Twitter-apology_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqSHbwjXwQFTHXC82JPxmrX_6Vm4soJX9-iLE8hFCwcmo.PNG?impolicy=logo-overlay", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Wright", "Ewan Somerville", "Dominic Penna", "Ben Riley-Smith", "Verity Bowman", "Michael Kugelman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/03/youtube-star-logan-paul-says-ashamed-backlash-grows-video-dead/", "title": "YouTube star Logan Paul says he\u2019s \u2018ashamed\u2019 as backlash grows over video of dead body in Japan \u2018suicide forest\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2c769d", "msapplication-TileImage": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "The Telegraph", "msapplication-config": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/etc/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/icons/mstile-70x70.png", "theme-color": "#072A3A", "description": "YouTuber Logan Paul has said he is &ldquo;ashamed&rdquo;
