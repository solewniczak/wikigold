The former public school teacher died of a heart condition.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201c6 Months ago today I said bye for now to the first smile I\u2019d ever seen. I miss you So much Mommy. I know you\u2019re there and I can\u2019t wait to see that smile again. Till then 143\u2026,\u201d Latifah, 48, wrote alongside the smiling photo.\n\nThe actress announced in an emotional statement that Owens had died back in March after struggling with a heart condition for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cIt is with a heavy heart that I share the news my mother, Rita Owens passed away today,\u201d said Latifah. \u201cAnyone that has ever met her knows what a bright light she was on this earth. She was gentle, but strong, sweet, but sassy, worldy but pragmatic, a woman of great faith and certainly the love of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe had struggled with a heart condition for many years and her battle is now over,\u201d Latifah shared. \u201cI am heartbroken but know she is at peace. Thank you for your kindness, support and respect for our privacy at this time.

And when we go through these things together as a family, I realize, these are the important things, these are the important moments.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fqueen-latifah-rita-owens-6.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fqueen-latifah-rita-owens-6.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fqueen-latifah-rita-owens-6.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ale Russian", "September"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/queen-latifah-pays-tribute-mom-6-months-after-death/", "title": "Queen Latifah Remembers Mom Rita Owens 6 Months After Her Death at 69: 'I Miss You'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "News,Queen Latifah", "news_keywords": "News,Queen Latifah", "description": "Queen Latifah, who was her mom's primary caretaker for the last years of her life, posted a sweet picture of the two on her Instagram with a touching note", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Queen Latifah Remembers Mom Rita Owens 6 Months After Her Death at 69: 'I Miss You'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/queen-latifah-pays-tribute-mom-6-months-after-death/", "description": "Queen Latifah, who was her mom's primary caretaker for the last years of her life, posted a sweet picture of the two on her Instagram with a touching note", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fqueen-latifah-rita-owens-6.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/movies/queen-latifah-pays-tribute-mom-6-months-after-death/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fqueen-latifah-rita-owens-6.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/movies/queen-latifah-pays-tribute-mom-6-months-after-death/", "title": "Queen Latifah Remembers Mom Rita Owens 6 Months After Her Death at 69: 'I Miss You'", "description": "Queen Latifah, who was her mom's primary caretaker for the last years of her life, posted a sweet picture of the two on her Instagram with a touching note", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fqueen-latifah-rita-owens-6.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/movies/queen-latifah-pays-tribute-mom-6-months-after-death/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
