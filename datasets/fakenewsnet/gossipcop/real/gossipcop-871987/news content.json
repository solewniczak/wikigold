Don\u2019t forget to subscribe for more exclusive interviews and photos, only in EW.\n\nWedding bells will soon be ringing at Grey Sloan!\n\nEW can exclusively reveal that Jo (Camilla Luddington) and Alex (Justin Chambers) will be getting married in the season 14 finale of Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\n\nSlated to air Thursday, May 17, the finale is gearing up to be a big event \u2014 which, in the world of Shondaland, means things will certainly go awry.\n\n\u201cI am so excited for Jo and Alex to finally seal the deal and get married,\u201d Luddington tells EW. \u201cBut in true Jolex form, the wedding will have lots of twists and turns to it.\u201d See?\n\nEW\u2019s exclusive photo from the wedding definitely seems to speak to impending disaster.\n\nELLEN POMPEO, CAMILLA LUDDINGTON, JUSTIN CHAMBERS Credit: Eric McCandless/ABC\n\nIt\u2019s been a long road to the altar for these two. After his failed marriage to Izzie (Katherine Heigl) in the early years of Grey\u2019s, Alex and Jo started dating in season 9. But the couple hit a major roadblock at the end of season 12 when Jo rebuffed Alex\u2019s proposal, afraid to reveal her name wasn\u2019t actually Jo Wilson \u2014 it was Brooke Stadler \u2014 and she was still married to an abusive man from whom she ran.\n\nAfter Alex nearly landed in jail back in season 13 \u2014 long story involving him beating up DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti), whom he believed was hooking up with Jo \u2014 and Jo\u2019s estranged ex Paul (Matthew Morrison) ended up dead in season 14, Jo ultimately proposed to Alex earlier this year.\n\nThe ABC medical drama will also close out the season with emotional farewells to longtime series regulars Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew. Geena Davis will be reprising her role as Dr. Nicole Herman, who returns to discuss an exciting opportunity with Arizona, seemingly signaling how Arizona will exit.\n\nDetails on Drew\u2019s departure are being kept under wraps, but the logline for the penultimate episode, in which Davis also returns, does tease that one of Grey Sloan Memorial\u2019s own will be seriously injured, prompting the team to reflect on what is truly important to them. Could their patient end up being Drew\u2019s character April? We\u2019ll find out when the penultimate hour airs on May 10.\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.", "images":
