Authorities said the man was carrying a knife and a ticket for the concert when he was arrested just a block away from the venue.\n\nAs of Sunday, Hunt was being held without bail for charges of attempted kidnapping with a weapon and aggravated stalking with a credible threat. Police have also confirmed that despite the seriousness of Hunt's attempt, he was unsuccessful in making any kind of physical contact with the singer.\n\n\"Thanks for the messages,\" Del Rey said Sunday afternoon on Twitter, adding that her tour will march on and she \"can\u2019t wait to see everyone\" in Atlanta on Monday.", "images": ["https://variancemagazine.com/images/coin-variance-194033.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/notd-nightly-variance-194033.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/anthony-russo-variance-193033.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/coi-variance-194043.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/sophia-194032.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/variance-social-twitter-green.png", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/omar-apollo-variance-149303.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/dbmk-194023.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/amaya-493024.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/august-royals-193033.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/father-john-493033.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/rex-orange-county-variance-393032.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/maverick-193324.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/two-another-variance-193033.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/variance-social-spotify-green.png", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/caroline-139304.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/winnetka-bowling-league-variance-149303.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/charlie-reed-variance-194034.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/tove-134940.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/ruel-variance-493022.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/variance-social-youtube-green.png", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/omar-apollo-variance-283034.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/variance-social-instagram-green.png", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/joesef-194033.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/variance-stroke-6-black-icon.png", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/ross-quinn-variance-493033.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/billie-eilish-variance-139304.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/amber-mark-variance-139304.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/luno-variance-393032.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/variance-social-fb-green.png", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/tiana-483034.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/giift-variance-194032.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/lana-del-rey-variance-magazine-8904.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/tuition-193033.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/portugal-the-man-variance-148302.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/jesse-variance-904443.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/la-rochelle-variance-194040.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/phebe-variance-294043.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/rex-orange-county-variance-184933.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/lucky-daye-294034.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/dua-lipa-megan-variance-403434.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/black-keys-variance-194032.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/wild-rivers-493032.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/mgk-willow-variance-194033.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/arlo-149302.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/gayle-variance-294032.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/lil-durk-variance-80933.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/pusha-t-variance-284032.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/zendaya-euphoria-season-2-variance-843022.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/aaron-taos-variance-95724.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/wallows-variance-194033.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/bad-bunny-variance-credit-dan-deslover-193403.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/push-58953.jpg", "https://variancemagazine.com/images/florence-340324.jpg"], "top_img": "https://variancemagazine.com/images/lana-del-rey-variance-magazine-8904.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Schmitt"], "canonical_link": "https://variancemagazine.com/news/8894-lana-del-rey-doing-fine-attempted-kidnapping", "title": "Lana Del Rey 'Doing Fine' After Man Arrested for Attempting to Kidnap Her", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "keywords": "lana del rey, music, tour, orlando", "author": "Tyler Schmitt", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@VARIANCE", "creator": "@VARIANCE", "url": "https://variancemagazine.com/news/8894-lana-del-rey-doing-fine-attempted-kidnapping", "title": "Lana Del Rey &#039;Doing Fine&#039; After Man Arrested for Attempting to Kidnap Her", "description": "Her tour is continuing with the next show scheduled for Atlanta.", "image": "https://variancemagazine.com/images/variance-og-image.jpg"}, "description": "Her tour is continuing with the next show scheduled for Atlanta.", "generator": "Joomla!
