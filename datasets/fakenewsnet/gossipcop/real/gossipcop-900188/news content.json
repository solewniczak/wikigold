Ahead of their appearance Thursday on Good Morning America, the actress from The Last Jedi was spotted giving a pep talk to the roly-poly droid for the live taping.\n\n\u201cHoney, you don\u2019t have to be nervous,\u201d Dern tells BB-8. \u201cBB, you\u2019ve done this so much. We\u2019ve been doing press all week.\u201d\n\nHer advice for dealing with all the cameras? \u201cStay focused and have a great time, BB!\u201d\n\nIf that weren\u2019t enough, the video (shown above) ends with Dern giving the mechanical ball of love a belly rub.\n\nReese Witherspoon, Dern\u2019s Big Little Lies costar, even commented on the exchange. \u201cI love him! Can BB-8 be in [Big Little Lies season 2]?\u201d Witherspoon tweeted. Dern already has an idea of how that would work out.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026yes. Easy. Renata just bought the real BB-8 for Christmas for her daughter. Knowing u would likely get your daughter the toy,\u201d she wrote.\n\nDern was previously captured scratching BB-8\u2019s belly at an event for Star Wars: The Last Jedi. \u201cYou are so cute!\u201d she exclaims in a video posted to her Twitter account. \u201cYou\u2019re the best, come on!\u201d She also tells the droid that, though those porgs are \u201cadorable,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re my guy, BB-8.\u201d\n\nHead to theaters this weekend to see if Admiral Holdo and BB-8 are just as adorable in Star Wars: The Last Jedi as they are in real life.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F04%2F09%2Fnick-romano-image.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Flauradern_gma.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Flauradern_gma.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Romano", "December", "At Pm Est"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/14/star-wars-last-jedi-laura-dern-bb-8-pep-talk/", "title": "Laura Dern giving BB-8 a pep talk will brighten your day", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Laura Dern,Star Wars", "news_keywords": "Laura Dern,Star Wars", "description": "Laura Dern giving BB-8 a pep talk will brighten your day", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Laura Dern giving BB-8 a pep talk will brighten your day", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/14/star-wars-last-jedi-laura-dern-bb-8-pep-talk/", "description": "Laura Dern giving BB-8 a pep talk will brighten your day", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Flauradern_gma.jpg", "width": 1800, "height": 900}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/14/star-wars-last-jedi-laura-dern-bb-8-pep-talk/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Flauradern_gma.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/14/star-wars-last-jedi-laura-dern-bb-8-pep-talk/", "title": "Laura Dern giving BB-8 a pep talk will brighten your day", "description": "Laura Dern giving BB-8 a pep talk will brighten your day", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Flauradern_gma.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/14/star-wars-last-jedi-laura-dern-bb-8-pep-talk/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513206000.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
