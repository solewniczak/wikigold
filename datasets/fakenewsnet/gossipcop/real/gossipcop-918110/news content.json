Growing up as a kid, I dreamt of winning championships and worked really hard. But then to have something like this come out of left field.

To be here right now and have a sense of validation, this is crazy.\u201d\n\nThe former guard, who said he\u2019s working on five novels, also explained why he decided to get political on the Oscars stage. \u201cFor us, not just as athletes, but as people in general, we have the ability to speak up for what it is that we believe in; whether you\u2019re an athlete or not, whether you\u2019re an actor or not,\u201d Bryant continued in the press room. \u201cWe have the ability to speak up as well as people have a right to criticize.
