He was one of the greats. So kind, funny, talented. We will all miss him,\" Wilson tweeted, linking to the Los Angeles Inner City Cultural Center, where donations can be made in Dane's name.\n\nWilson also included a scene he shared with Dane in which Hank unofficially inducts Wilson's character Dwight Schrute into the role of \"Official Security Manager of the Branch.\"\n\nOther Office stars chimed in with kind words about their time working with Dane.\n\nDane appeared on more than 20 episodes of The Office, and was known by fans for his short, but hilarious cameos.\n\nHugh Dane in an episode of 'The Office.'

(Only to get there and find they'd already been let out by the cleaning crew.)\n\nVia Giphy\n\nVia Giphy\n\nWhile Dane will always be a beloved member of The Office cast, he appeared other hit shows throughout his career, including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Boy Meets World, Roc, Friends, Sister, Sister, Hart of Dixie, and more.\n\nHe also has credits in popular films like Bridesmaids and Little Fockers.", "images": ["https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/videos/060Le3vdI1zRLViRyq5BxTP/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1647415190.jpg",
