And speaking of leaders gleefully robbing their constituents, a Girl Scout troop leader in Pike, Kentucky has allegedly made off with an estimated $15,000 worth of cookies.\n\nAccording to Munchies, one Leah Ann Vick has been indicted on felony theft charges by a Kentucky grand jury for stealing the sugary snacks. To visualize that, one box of cookies goes for roughly $10 on Amazon, meaning that Vick possibly stole almost 1,500 boxes of cookies.\n\nVick, the former troop leader of the Wilderness Road Chapter, apparently made off with the tasty treats when they were dropped off to the chapter by the national branch. She then promptly disappeared with the snacks, and as District Attorney Rick Bartley told the Appalachian News-Express, \u201canyone who has tried to contact her about them has not been able to contact her.\u201d Say what you will about the ethical dilemma of robbing innocent children, making off with over a thousand boxes of cookies is a logistical triumph in itself.\n\nWith a whopping 4 addresses associated with her name, Vick has thus far eluded capture, leaving a trail of unanswered questions in her wake. How did she pull off the heist? Was she motivated by greed or revenge? Will the cookies be sold to the highest bidder on the black market? Sadly we don\u2019t have the answers, but we do have cookie recipes to make if you\u2019ve developed a craving after all that cookie talk. And unlike Girl Scout cookies, these won\u2019t get stolen. Hopefully.\n\nUpdate: The local NBC affiliate reports that Vick has since been arrested and faces 10 years in prison.\n\nh/t Munchies", "images": ["https://www.saveur.com/uploads/2019/03/18/FYDA5SRCV3VLQPFWP26BUDRH24.jpg?auto=webp", "https://www.saveur.com/uploads/2022/03/09/Saveur_Wendall-Smith_EmilyDorio_103-scaled.jpg?auto=webp&width=1440&crop=16:9,offset-x50", "https://www.saveur.com/uploads/2019/03/18/FYDA5SRCV3VLQPFWP26BUDRH24.jpg?auto=webp&width=785&height=588.61208713985", "https://www.saveur.com/uploads/2022/03/09/LPetrilla_FishFryBeautyShots-Saveur-3424-scaled.jpg?auto=webp&width=720&crop=16:9,offset-x50", "https://www.saveur.com/uploads/2021/03/12/saveur_logo-black-1.png?auto=webp", "https://www.saveur.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Ukraine_FEATURE.png?auto=webp&width=720&crop=16:9,offset-x50"], "top_img": "https://www.saveur.com/uploads/2019/03/18/FYDA5SRCV3VLQPFWP26BUDRH24.jpg?auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Burke"], "canonical_link": "https://www.saveur.com/girl-scout-troop-leader-steals-15000-worth-of-cookies/", "title": "A Girl Scout Troop Leader Has Disappeared with $15,000 Worth of Cookies", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.saveur.com/uploads/2021/06/22/cropped-Saveur_FAV_CRM-1.png?auto=webp&width=270&height=270", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "A Girl Scout troop leader disappears with $15,000 worth of cookies in Pike, Kentucky.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "A Girl Scout Troop Leader Has Disappeared with $15,000 Worth of Cookies", "description": "A Girl Scout troop leader disappears with $15,000 worth of cookies in Pike, Kentucky.", "url": "https://www.saveur.com/girl-scout-troop-leader-steals-15000-worth-of-cookies/", "site_name": "Saveur", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.saveur.com/uploads/2019/03/18/FYDA5SRCV3VLQPFWP26BUDRH24.jpg?auto=webp", "width": 1423, "height": 1067}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Ian Burke", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "facebook-domain-verification": "zvsj4jjqq1c0sq5djg5yhictjd8378", "generator": "WordPress 5.9.1", "sailthru.date": "2017-05-17 22:45:00", "sailthru.title": "A Girl Scout Troop Leader Has Disappeared with $15,000 Worth of Cookies", "sailthru.tags": ",Food,news,shortform,true crime,Food,Ian Burke,saveur", "sailthru.author": "Ian Burke", "sailthru.description": "It\u2019s only slightly harder than stealing candy from a baby", "sailthru.image.full": "https://www.saveur.com/uploads/2019/03/18/FYDA5SRCV3VLQPFWP26BUDRH24.jpg?auto=webp", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://www.saveur.com/uploads/2019/03/18/FYDA5SRCV3VLQPFWP26BUDRH24.jpg?auto=webp", "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-17T22:45:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-17T22:45:00+00:00"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495061100.0, "source": "https://www.saveur.com", "summary": ""}
