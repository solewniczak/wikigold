I think I might still be asleep. My dog woke me up. My dog made a noise and I habitually picked up my phone and had lots of well wishes, which was very exciting.\n\nThe show just came out, were you surprised to be embraced so quickly?\n\nI\u2019m thrilled and surprised and so honored that the show\u2019s gotten this recognition so fast. We\u2019re in incredible company and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful.\n\nIs there anyone you\u2019re excited to be in a room with?\n\nYou should see my face right now. Issa Rae is a hero of mine and I\u2019m going to try not to completely creep her out. I love \u201cInsecure.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of my favorite shows on right now and I love how smart and capable specifically the two main characters are but, as any woman in their 20s can relate to, they\u2019re struggling to get it together despite how amazing they are. I love the friendship between Issa and Molly so much. You don\u2019t often see true depictions of a female friendship on TV that way, and I need to see Season 3 already.\n\nYour show is about a friendship of sorts.\n\nIt\u2019s a blossoming friendship. They\u2019re still in denial about it -- or at least Susie [Alex Borstein] is.\n\nI\u2019m not sure they have much in common and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting about it. I\u2019m used to one-dimensional female friendships. It\u2019s become a kind of trope. That\u2019s what\u2019s so exciting to me about it. They feel completely different from one another. Susie and Midge\u2019s [relationship] is at completely different time but the friendship between Issa and Molly is one that I totally recognize. One where you can cuss each other out and tell each other that you hate each other and show up at their door the next day and drink wine and move through it. It\u2019s complicated and it\u2019s flawed and it\u2019s beautiful.\n\n\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d is about this very specific scene and very specific time period in New York. Why do you think modern viewers are embracing it?\n\nFirst of all it\u2019s a fun show, and the world is on fire and it\u2019s nice to escape for a little bit. But additionally I don\u2019t think there are many women like Midge on TV, and there should be more.\n\nI think a lot of the women in this category represent that -- different kinds of women and different kinds of stories, and there are still so many more that need to be told. I hope that the success of this show and shows like \u201cInsecure\u201d and \u201cSMILF\u201d encourage people to make more content like this and tell more women\u2019s stories.\n\nAnd it\u2019s about women in comedy, which is something we\u2019re still having conversations about in 2017.\n\nI would argue that our show hasn\u2019t quite reached the conversation on a deeper level about women in comedy. At this point it\u2019s still about this woman whose life has fallen apart, struggling to reinvent herself and find her voice. As we move forward we\u2019ll get more into the conversation about what it means to be a woman in comedy.\n\nThere\u2019s this repeated idea that people ask if Susie and Midge can sing because you\u2019re not valuable unless you have other skills, because women can\u2019t just be funny. Jane Lynch\u2019s character [Sophie] says to her, you want them to laugh at you, not want to ... you. You need to be a character, or you need to have a [penis].\n\nI think that\u2019s also frustrating for Midge. That\u2019s been Sophie\u2019s experience of the world up to that point. Midge defying that is valid, but Sophie\u2019s feeling that is also in response to her own experience.\n\nAmy Sherman-Palladino\u2019s dialogue is known for being really fast. Were there any lines that gave you particular trouble or kept you up at night?\n\nYes, there were quite a few I think I still remember. The one that I had a lot of trouble with, I think it\u2019s in Episode 2 where she says, \u201cI could be a cool chick with a doorman and a Kelvinator Foodarama refrigerator, can\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nAlso there\u2019s one later on where Midge and Imogene are packing goodie bags for her son\u2019s birthday and she says something like, \u201cYou\u2019re putting the tiny Tina baby carriages in the boys\u2019 bag.\u201d I could not get that one out of my mouth. There is so much B-roll of my saying \u201cthe Tina Turner baby carriages.\u201d\n\nI also yelled at Amy at one point for naming my children Ethan and Esther. Trying saying \u201cEthan and Esther\u201d five times fast.\n\nSo how do you prepare for that? Do you just say \u201crubber baby buggy bumpers\u201d over and over?\n\nI actually do. I do a full Shakespearean mouth warm-up and just vats of coffee. It\u2019s really all of that, all those tongue-twisters -- red leather yellow leather, unique New York unique New York. Or just saying the lines on repeat.\n\nThe reason I can say them is because I spent so much time rehearsing them. [Really, really fast] \u201cYou\u2019re putting the tiny Tina carriages in the boy\u2019s bag. You\u2019re putting the tiny Tina carriages in the boy\u2019s bag.\u201d Just to try to get it out of my face.\n\nSo when do you go back to work?\n\nWe have a Season 2. I don\u2019t know exactly when we\u2019ll start, but I\u2019ve been hearing rumors of sometime in the spring.\n\nWhat are you up to until then?\n\nCurrently I\u2019m at the dog park. Holidays coming up, so I am going to go see some family. I have a project or two swirling I may be able to squeeze in before we start again. But it\u2019s up in the air in a lovely way.\n\nHave you seen any of the nominated movies or shows?\n\nNo, I\u2019m so behind. I don\u2019t have a TV and I\u2019ve been trying, I\u2019m excited to see all of these projects, all of these movies, now that I\u2019m back and all of the screeners are coming. I\u2019ve been trying to put the technology down a little bit.\n\n\u201cLady Bird\u201d is top of my list. I can\u2019t wait to see \u201cI, Tonya.\u201d It looks amazing. I saw \u201cThe Big Sick,\u201d that was one of my favorite movies this year.\n\nSo before Midge, did people recognize you as Rachel from \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and do you feel like Midge is erasing that?\n\nThat\u2019s probably the one I get recognized from the most. But it\u2019s only when I look like death and I\u2019m leaving the gym or have gone to the dog park with pink zit cream on my face. I don\u2019t know what that says.\n\nI think one of the things I enjoy about acting is the transformation and part of that is certainly the physical transformation. If people are confused forever, wondering where they have seen me before, that feels like exactly where I want to live. It feels like something\u2019s working.\n\nHow does it feel going into an awards season at a time when the industry is going through a serious reckoning about the treatment of women?\n\nAs somebody who\u2019s never really previously been involved in the awards scene generally, I\u2019m curious what that will feel like in person.\n\nI\u2019m hoping\u2026 it feels like we\u2019re on the cusp of a major shift in this industry. I think shows like \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d are one part of a very multifaceted solution to this problem. This is a show that is written, produced, directed, created by an extraordinary woman, and produced by an extraordinary man [Daniel Palladino] who loves extraordinary women, about an extraordinary woman at a time when women weren\u2019t encouraged to be extraordinary.\n\nThis is a show that lifts women up, that highlights some of our battles and employs us behind and in front of the camera. Amazon gave and continues to give the money to make this production great, and so I hope that the success of shows like this is part of this new frontier in Hollywood.\n\nThere are so many other women\u2019s stories out there that need to be told and I hope we recognize that as the way to move forward.", "images": ["https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/22c1ad4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x840+0+30/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2F8f%2F601b950b58ceed5ae9c5b11d162c%2Fla-lb-media-quad-photo-20171211-160342", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/22c1ad4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x840+0+30/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2F8f%2F601b950b58ceed5ae9c5b11d162c%2Fla-lb-media-quad-photo-20171211-160342", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-golden-globes-2018-nominations-htmlstory.html", "title": "2018 Golden Globes updates: Movies race remains wide open and women are front and center on TV", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "2018 Golden Globes updates: Movies race remains wide open and women are front and center on TV", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-golden-globes-2018-nominations-htmlstory.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/22c1ad4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x840+0+30/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2F8f%2F601b950b58ceed5ae9c5b11d162c%2Fla-lb-media-quad-photo-20171211-160342", "url": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/22c1ad4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x840+0+30/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2F8f%2F601b950b58ceed5ae9c5b11d162c%2Fla-lb-media-quad-photo-20171211-160342", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "description": "The 2018 Golden Globes nominations have been announced.
