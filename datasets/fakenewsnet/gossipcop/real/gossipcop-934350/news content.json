This month, the award-winning actress and best-selling author filmed a PSA for the Child Mind Institute's #MyYoungerSelf campaign, and in it, she talks about how she learned to live with her post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\"Hey guys, it's Gabrielle Union, and I'm here to tell you that I am a PTSD survivor, thriver, badass M.F.-er,\" she says in the video. \"I was diagnosed with PTSD at 19 after I was raped at gunpoint, and I didn't let it stop me. I didn't want it to define my whole life, and it doesn't have to. Asking for help, needing help, doesn't make you weak or less worthy of love or support or success. You can literally be anything you want to be.\"\n\n\"PTSD isn't a death sentence,\" Union continues. \"You don't have to be alone or feel isolated. There are so many of us out there who are dealing with exactly what you're dealing with and it doesn't make you weak. It doesn't make you anything but human. And we all have something, and you might even become a successful actress and best-selling author, and, I don't know, be dope, because that's what you deserve.\"\n\nContent This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThis isn't the first time Union has talked about her PTSD. The actress, who is outspoken about issues like therapy, infertility, and sexual assault, previously shared that her PTSD was triggered by hearing other survivors' stories on her book tour. \"On my book tour, a lot of cities felt like a revival \u2014 there were so many disclosures of abuse during the Q&A portion of talks and during the book signing; even as I was driving away people were flagging down my car in tears. I didn't realize how big the need was for so many people to just get it out, to have someone look them in the eye and say, 'I believe you,'\" she told Redbook earlier this year.\n\n\"I Skyped a lot with my life coach, because the horrors that I was taking in triggered my PTSD,\" she added. \"I feel a responsibility to offer that sense of safety and support. And, luckily, I have the means to help myself at the end of the night.\"", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/5af5c844bf6159158812ea4f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-950716652.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5af5c844bf6159158812ea4f/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-950716652.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5af5c844bf6159158812ea4f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-950716652.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Emily Wang"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/gabrielle-union-ptsd-experience", "title": "Gabrielle Union Opens Up About Being a PTSD Survivor in Inspiring Video", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Gabrielle Union talked about the PTSD she's experienced since she was 19 years old in a video for The Child Mind Institute's #MyYoungerSelf campaign.", "id": "5af5c844618fc612cd1c0869", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5af5c844618fc612cd1c0869", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Gabrielle Union talked about the PTSD she's experienced since she was 19 years old in a video for The Child Mind Institute's #MyYoungerSelf campaign.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5af5c844bf6159158812ea4f/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-950716652.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5af5c844bf6159158812ea4f/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-950716652.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "She's reaching out to other survivors in an inspiring new video.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5af5c844bf6159158812ea4f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-950716652.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Gabrielle Union Opens Up About Not Letting PTSD Define Her Life", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.self.com/story/gabrielle-union-ptsd-experience"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-05-11T18:10:05.683Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5af5c844bf6159158812ea4f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-950716652.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526062205.683, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
