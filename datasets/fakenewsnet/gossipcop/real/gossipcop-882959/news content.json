Rashida Jones and Pat Rosnick are writing the 20th Century Fox film.\n\nThe buzz about a potential sequel grew after the 2017 Emmys in September, when the three co-stars appeared on stage together. At the time, Fonda recalled that in the film, they had a \"sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical\" boss. The ladies seemed to allude to Mr. Trump when Tomlin responded, \"We still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot.\"\n\nIn March, Parton said she and her co-stars got their ducks in a row because of the recent conversation around gender inequality.\n\n\"All these years we've talked about doing a sequel to '9 to 5,' but it never made any real sense,\" Parton said. \"Until just recently [with] all the equal work for equal pay and all the harassment in the workplace [backlash] \u2013 we decided that we are going to try to do another one.\"\n\nShe also revealed, \"This new idea [is] going to bring some new girls in ... and they're gonna find us, the old characters. We've all come up with a business of our own. So, they come to find us just to get some input.\"\n\nLily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda speak onstage during the 69th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards at Microsoft Theater on September 17, 2017 in Los Angeles.
