MTV displayed a black screen with type informing viewers that Evans chose to follow the driver after he turned off the highway. The next scene showed Evans reaching for a handgun and placing it beside her while her son, Jace, sat in the passenger seat.\n\nA chaotic series of events followed. Evans called her husband and told him that she was in front of the other driver\u2019s house. MTV informed viewers that she \u201cunintentionally backed in to the other driver\u2019s mailbox.\u201d Evans told her husband that the other driver hit her car and was blocking her in. \u201cDude, leave me alone!\u201d she yelled before the show cut to another black screen: \u201cAt this point, Jenelle pulled out her firearm.\u201d\n\nMTV showed Evans speeding away from the driver, who she said was following her. After apparently losing the driver\u2019s trail, Evans tearily recounted the ordeal to a police officer who pulled her over after she turned onto another road. According to TMZ, neither driver was charged in the April incident.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first controversy involving Evans \u2013 or other cast members of MTV\u2019s popular franchise, which launched in 2009 with \u201c16 and Pregnant.\u201d Let\u2019s take a look back at some of the drama that has unfolded in front of (and away) from the cameras.\n\nJenelle Evans. Evans has a long string of arrests and legal issues \u2013 including a long-standing custody battle with her mother, Barbara Evans, over Jace. The mother of three has also spoken openly about battling drug addiction.In 2015, Evans was arrested in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for driving without a license. At the time, E! News reported that it was her 11th arrest in less than five years.\n\nIn February, her husband, David Eason \u2013 with whom she was shown talking in Monday\u2019s episode \u2013 was fired by MTV after allegedly posting homophobic tweets.\n\nRyan Edwards.

After that arrest, Us Weekly reported that Bookout had filed for orders of protection against her ex on behalf of herself, her husband, Taylor McKinney, and her three children \u2013 one of whom she shares with Edwards.\n\nEdwards announced last week that he and his wife, Mackenzie Standifer, would not be returning to the spinoff \u201cTeen Mom OG.\u201d Last June, the couple was featured in a harrowing scene that showed Edwards driving erratically \u2013 on the way to elope \u2013 as Standifer attempted to help him steer the vehicle and accused him of taking Xanax.\n\nMTV was criticized for airing footage of an impaired driver. \u201cMTV does not condone driving under the influence,\u201d the network said in a statement to People. \u201cRyan\u2019s erratic behavior was due to actions that he took without anyone\u2019s prior knowledge.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, just days before his most recent arrest, Edwards slammed the network in an Instagram post about his struggles with addiction. \u201cHelp is out there, don\u2019t take everything you see on MTV as factual truth,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to show me or Mack in a happy light or that I am active in my recovery.\u201d\n\nFarrah Abraham. Abraham, who was also part of the show that launched the \u201cTeen Mom\u201d franchise, was arrested in June after allegedly hitting a security guard at the Beverly Hills Hotel. According to TMZ, which published a video of Abraham yelling during her arrest, she was later charged with battery and resisting an officer.In 2013, she pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months probation in a DUI case.\n\nAbraham said earlier this year that she would not return to \u201cTeen Mom OG,\u201d making room for new cast member Bristol Palin. In March, the reality star settled a lawsuit against MTV \u2018s parent company, Viacom, after alleging the network \u201cdiscriminated against ... and sex shamed\u201d her after she appeared in pornographic videos.\n\nAmber Portwood. Also part of the original \u201c16 and Pregnant\u201d cast, Portwood was often shown having explosive \u2013 and physical \u2013 arguments with her ex-boyfriend, Gary Shirley \u2013 in some cases, arguing in front of their daughter Leah. In 2010, she was charged with felony domestic battery and child neglect. Shirley was arrested in 2011 \u2013 for driving with a suspended license \u2013 after one of their arguments.In 2012, Portwood was ordered to serve a five-year prison sentence for a felony drug charge after violating her probation requirements.
