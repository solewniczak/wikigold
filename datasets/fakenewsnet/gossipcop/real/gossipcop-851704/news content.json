But a few hours later, she clapped back at her critics with another brief thread.\n\n\u201cI in no way meant that depressed people should \u2018stop being sad,'\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with depression my whole f\u2014ing life, so obviously I know that. I\u2019m saying find yourself some help. And don\u2019t wait for things to change. You have to go out and get that for yourself.\u201d\n\nShe also touched upon the steps she had to take to find happiness: \u201cThat\u2019s what I did when I moved to L.A. for the second time trying to follow my dream. I was proactive about changing my life.\u201d\n\nYou can read her tweets below.\n\nEARLIER: Betty Cooper may be investigating a murder onscreen, but actress Lili Reinhart has faced her own share of darkness off of it.\n\nThe actress opened up about her depression in what she called a \u201cTwitter rant\u201d for Mental Health Awareness Month. Marking the one year anniversary of The CW ordering Riverdale to series, Reinhart said the show saved her life.\n\n\u201cI cried tears of joy. In that moment I became a working actress with a steady job. Something I had been working towards for 7 years,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd now here we are, gearing up to film season 2. And I could not be more grateful. Riverdale came into my life when I was going through the worst depression I had ever experienced. And in the end it completely saved me.\u201d\n\nReinhart credits hard work with getting where she is. \u201cAnd when I\u2019m feeling depressed or sad, I remind myself how far I\u2019ve come. And how I didn\u2019t let my depression consume me,\u201d she continued. \u201cTo anyone out there who feels depressed or hopeless\u2026 do not f\u2014ing give up on yourself. You\u2019re all you\u2019ve got. And you deserve the world. Your mental health should be your priority. Don\u2019t forget that. This is your life.. and you\u2019ve only got one. So don\u2019t waste it by being sad.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will get through whatever you\u2019re going through now. And you\u2019ll be so much stronger at the end of it. You\u2019re stronger than you know,\u201d she concludes. \u201cI felt the need to put some love out into the world today. I encourage you to do the same.\u201d\n\nEW recently declared Reinhart a \u201cTwitter Queen\u201d for her hilarious and empowering feed, which includes her own self-created memes while live-tweeting her show, and a pitch-perfect takedown of body shamers. Her message about mental health is just her latest inspiring social media triumph.\n\nThe season finale of Riverdale aired May 11 on The CW, which gave the show an early season 2 renewal for a second season in March.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F01%2F20%2FRVD501b_0168r.jpg",
