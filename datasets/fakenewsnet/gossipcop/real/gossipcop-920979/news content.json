{"url": "https://www.allure.com/gallery/editors-favorite-new-beauty-products", "text": "At Allure, we get inundated with the latest and greatest beauty offerings every day. Most of it is exciting, some of it confusing, and sometimes it gets overwhelming, especially now that our homes have become our offices. Alas, that is the beauty editor's burden to bear.\n\nWhen we really like something, you can trust that our opinion has come from vetting it against everything we've seen before, including our longtime favorites. (We've even written love letters to some of the products we hold most dear.) But we're always open to finding \u2014 and sharing \u2014 new favorites. It's a big beauty playground out there, so we'll gladly do the dirty work to test everything under the sun. And the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me often graduate to our Best of Beauty trials.\n\nBut let's stick to the present for now. Each week, Allure editors select the new hair, makeup, and skin-care products we're currently obsessing over. Trying to narrow down our favorites to just one or two products can be hard, but we manage. Check out what our editors can't get enough of right now.", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/622229ed47c699773b6bdab2/1:1/w_320%2Cc_limit/Rare%2520Beauty%2520Perfect%2520Strokes%2520Universal%2520Volumizing%2520Mascara%2520ABB%2520copy.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/621d071e058248bec262bc75/1:1/w_320%2Cc_limit/adwoa%2520beauty%2520Blue%2520Tansy%2520Reparative%2520Conditioner%2520%2520.jpeg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/621d041fe844b00b21ca26a8/1:1/w_320%2Cc_limit/COOLA%2520%2520Dew%2520Good%2520Illuminating%2520Serum%2520Probiotic%2520Sunscreen.jpeg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/621d068cd7fd23bfa54bc467/1:1/w_320%2Cc_limit/OLEHENRIKSEN%2520Strength%2520Trainer%2520Peptide%2520Boost%2520Moisturizer%2520%2520.jpeg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/621d0617d7fd23bfa54bc465/1:1/w_320%2Cc_limit/Curel%2520Daily%2520Healing%2520Hand%2520and%2520Body%2520Lotion.jpeg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/62222e07df08d8d7832139d5/1:1/w_320%2Cc_limit/Mented%2520Cosmetics%2520Liquid%2520Lipstick%2520in%2520Blood%2520Orange%2520ABB.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6228e42db8d324bb7760d3fc/16:9/w_320%2Cc_limit/Ed's%2520Faves%2520lede%2520March%252014%25202022.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/621d076bd0db07abaeb897a5/1:1/w_320%2Cc_limit/Shea%2520Radiance%2520Whipped%2520Shea%2520Butter.jpeg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/621d0554d7fd23bfa54bc463/1:1/w_320%2Cc_limit/Tend%2520Tonic%2520Mounth%2520Rinse.jpeg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/621d0597a5fb617f46e3d429/1:1/w_320%2Cc_limit/Ami%2520Cole%2520Skin-Enhancing%2520Concealer.jpeg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/62223add9e00028c1fe5a501/1:1/w_320%2Cc_limit/Shani%2520Darden%2520Skin%2520Care%2520Retinol%2520Reform%2520ABB.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/621d06543c1316abf45cb589/1:1/w_320%2Cc_limit/Kiehl's%2520Magic%2520Elixir%2520Scalp%2520&%2520Hair%2520Oil%2520Treatment.jpeg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/621d05dfe844b00b21ca26aa/1:1/w_320%2Cc_limit/Function%2520of%2520Beauty%2520Wavy%2520Hair%2520Mask.jpeg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/61684919da20723adf98a450/1:1/w_320%2Cc_limit/caliray%2520-%2520mascara%25203.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/622ba2b21cafecc72b4720fa/16:9/w_2580,c_limit/Sarah%20Han%20Caliray%20Mascara%20Social.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/622ba2b21cafecc72b4720fa/16:9/w_2580,c_limit/Sarah%20Han%20Caliray%20Mascara%20Social.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Allure Editors"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/gallery/editors-favorite-new-beauty-products", "title": "Allure Beauty Editors' Favorite Products This Week \u2014 Reviews", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "These are the beauty products Allure editors vetted and voted for \u2014\u00a0our new and exciting favorite picks.
