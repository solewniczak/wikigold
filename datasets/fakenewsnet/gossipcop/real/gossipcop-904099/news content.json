Investigators say he hit a tractor in rural Buchanan County, north of Aurora, in April 2017. While Soules stayed at the scene initially, he left before authorities arrived.\n\nKenneth Mosher died as a result of the crash.", "images": ["https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/ao-IUAJw8i-ICo1gLnrUjJ3dYNw=/800x450/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/TCWUXW5KRRNDLH5EBERTTHFX5A.jpg", "https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/T3QQw1b2rAD52OLVm9bUAx_EfYQ=/800x450/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/UKWPQXSAA5DJFJUVGMHITRUDPE.jpg", "https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/A3LoFkuhQga70eEjXtmmzQmKJeU=/800x450/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/X46WYB2KBFFMHN5M4UZPO4WNJ4.PNG", "https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/8sPlzgabG-n_fuXE9tMof4BqWaw=/800x450/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/FCBKY5RRCBBVPLOB4W6G2VPMJQ.jpg", "https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/99Z2hpZnjlv9TbYGCdmmVJZ5CnE=/980x0/smart/filters:quality(85)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/7K7JZLKG7ZMA5I77Y6XHPHGVJM.png", "https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/Q-otLw1LwqS0yuo8EwmnqUwPyuU=/800x450/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/TCVQ6AMMDBHV3EYYZLRPXVCGPA.png", "https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/2i0khsjoMoPHE1i8RQ-EKbiO5kE=/800x450/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/DMKEIYPVEJLWJMJYSH6VA64MWQ.jpg", "https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/6_kjEmTdQx0bPJybctevf3KcsEA=/800x450/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/R6UJVGGQAZEYNDCZQHKPBGO6BY.jpg", "https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/hX3hTuuLtewD3m8wddLb3ocjVWI=/800x450/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/CGZVPWCZXZAXBABXHYSTSP4W2M.jpg", "https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/b9Y7zdjn5SpkCTSE2PQhvVgBiUY=/1200x675/smart/filters:quality(85)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/7K7JZLKG7ZMA5I77Y6XHPHGVJM.png", "https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/uo_zYfEBNE7A7Brqc4d2y1ictfc=/800x450/smart/filters:quality(70)/do0bihdskp9dy.cloudfront.net/03-15-2022/t_c4a0373285e64d60b5c2364d8fe3098c_name_file_1280x720_2000_v3_1_.jpg", "https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/32JIXTWcAOux-xBJGHjjuoZIk3g=/800x450/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/Y3RWNC6EVRFNRBQ5CAL4GXHMAQ.jpg"], "top_img": "https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/99Z2hpZnjlv9TbYGCdmmVJZ5CnE=/980x0/smart/filters:quality(85)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/7K7JZLKG7ZMA5I77Y6XHPHGVJM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ellyn Felton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Chris-Soules-withdraws-motion-to-change-venue-499012051.html", "title": "Plea discussions underway regarding fatal crash and Chris Soules", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1", "distribution": "global", "rating": "general", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2022", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Chris-Soules-withdraws-motion-to-change-venue-499012051.html", "description": "An Iowa farmer who appeared on ABC's \"The Bachelor\" will not be appearing in court today after more motions for his trial have been made.", "image": "https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/99Z2hpZnjlv9TbYGCdmmVJZ5CnE=/980x0/smart/filters:quality(85)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/7K7JZLKG7ZMA5I77Y6XHPHGVJM.png", "site_name": "https://www.kcrg.com", "title": "Plea discussions underway regarding fatal crash and Chris Soules"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1063798276", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.graytv.android.kcrgnews", "burst": "kcrg", "robots": "index,follow,noarchive", "googlebot": "index", "googlebot-news": "index", "description": "An Iowa farmer who appeared on ABC's \"The Bachelor\" will not be appearing in court today after more motions for his trial have been made.", "twitter": {"description": "An Iowa farmer who appeared on ABC's \"The Bachelor\" will not be appearing in court today after more motions for his trial have been made.", "image": "https://gray-kcrg-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/99Z2hpZnjlv9TbYGCdmmVJZ5CnE=/980x0/smart/filters:quality(85)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/7K7JZLKG7ZMA5I77Y6XHPHGVJM.png", "title": "Plea discussions underway regarding fatal crash and Chris Soules", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@KCRG", "creator": "@KCRG"}, "fb": {"admins": 644426401, "app_id": 1482644542038403, "pages": 57827502171}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/kcrgtv9/"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.kcrg.com", "summary": ""}
