In fact, he\u2019s not on most social media sites. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t a few great parody sites out there.\n\nGyllenhaal referred to himself as a \u201cdrag and drop kind of guy\u201d while appearing on Conan, saying that he knows computers, but not very well. So, he kind of steers clear from anything more advanced than basic computing.\n\nOne of the best accounts out there is @JakeActivities, which happens to showcase funny photos of Gyllenhaal enjoying life.\n\nThe actor only recently heard about the website, and let\u2019s just say he was pretty into it.\n\nOne of our favorites is \u201cJake laughing at his sandwich.\u201d As he pointed out, sandwiches are hilarious.\n\nSurprisingly, @JakeActivities is still fairly new. The account launched this March, and currently has over 9,000 followers. Here are a few of our favorite tweets that Conan O\u2019Brien didn\u2019t cover.\n\nWhile it seems out of place, the ferret was part of a sketch that he helped out with on Amy Schumer\u2019s show, Inside Amy Schumer.\n\nBecause he\u2019s such a gentleman.\n\nFeeling a little nostalgic? Just check out the actor promoting Donnie Darko, well over a decade ago.\n\nHey, sometimes it\u2019s just that sunny out. Or, sometimes sunglasses just aren\u2019t as good as we thought prior to purchasing them.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F02%2F09%2FSwimsuits.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Fyuliya-kosolapova-bqirdOGHvYQ-unsplash-e1573767747444.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/misc/300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F07%2F08%2Fchiron-retrograde-2021.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2016%2F07%2F27%2Fkarenbelz-300x225-1.jpeg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fdream_about_ex.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=985&h=493&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F09%2F22%2Fjake-gyllenhaal1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F06%2F08%2Ffriendquestions-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F17%2Fboob-sweat.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F20%2Fsex-anxiety-tout.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=985&h=493&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F09%2F22%2Fjake-gyllenhaal1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Belz", "Updated Sep"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/jake-gyllenhaal-was-shown-a-twitter-account-that-makes-fun-of-his-entire-life/", "title": "Jake Gyllenhaal was shown a Twitter account that makes fun of his entire life", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "We think this account is funny, and we're so glad that Jake Gyllenhaal thinks it's humorous too.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Jake Gyllenhaal was shown a Twitter account that makes fun of his entire life", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/jake-gyllenhaal-was-shown-a-twitter-account-that-makes-fun-of-his-entire-life/", "description": "We think this account is funny, and we're so glad that Jake Gyllenhaal thinks it's humorous too.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=985&h=493&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F09%2F22%2Fjake-gyllenhaal1.jpg", "width": 985, "height": 493}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/jake-gyllenhaal-was-shown-a-twitter-account-that-makes-fun-of-his-entire-life/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F09%2F22%2Fjake-gyllenhaal1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/jake-gyllenhaal-was-shown-a-twitter-account-that-makes-fun-of-his-entire-life/", "title": "Jake Gyllenhaal was shown a Twitter account that makes fun of his entire life", "description": "We think this account is funny, and we're so glad that Jake Gyllenhaal thinks it's humorous too.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=985&h=493&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F09%2F22%2Fjake-gyllenhaal1.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/jake-gyllenhaal-was-shown-a-twitter-account-that-makes-fun-of-his-entire-life/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/oanBk7rVw44"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
