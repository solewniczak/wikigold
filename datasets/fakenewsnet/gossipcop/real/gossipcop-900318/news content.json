Thursday, December 14, 2017, shall henceforth be known as the day that Will Smith, famous actor, father of Jaden and Willow, husband of Jada, finally made an Instagram. And he\u2019s a natural, as it turns out. Since posting the inaugural photo (a duck-face selfie, naturally) a day ago, the actor has amassed more than a million followers, gotten verified, and posted seven photos. In terms of social media savvy, Will Smith is a veritable Selena Gomez.\n\nBut along the way, Smith got some advice from a couple of famous friends. The first, Ellen DeGeneres, queen of the celebrity selfie, gave Smith a comprehensive Instagram tutorial during her show on Thursday. After the actor announced he\u2019s \u201cfinally going on Instagram,\u201d DeGeneres helped him take a series of trendy portraits for the \u2018gram. They ran through duck-lips, a mirror selfie, a photo with a baby as a prop, a photo with vegetables as a prop, and a #TBT, all of which has since been uploaded onto Smith\u2019s Instagram. The most popular is, of course, the #TBT, a photo of Smith and DeGeneres recreating a still from the Fresh Prince of Bel-air opening credits that\u2019s gotten more than 366,000 likes.\n\nShortly after, Justin Timberlake became the first famous person to welcome Smith to Instagram. He posted a #TBT as well, along with some dad-friendly instructions.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Instagram @willsmith,\u201d he wrote in the caption. \u201cThis is called a #TBT. Which means Throwback Thursday. Which is a photo you post on Thursdays that you like, that was taken in the past. I like this photo because it\u2019s a photo of you and me. And we look like we are having a serious conversation about something very important. And that makes me feel important.\u201d\n\nSmith, however, is doing just fine on his own. He has posted his own #TBT, a vintage photo of the actor as a young baby. \u201cYa\u2019ll ain\u2019t got no filters like this,\u201d he wrote in the caption. All hail the Fresh Prince of Instagram.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2a17ea0a86c03b8be7c_016.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2a604027c40d5040fae_2007.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2a67ea0a86c03b8be82_2009.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2ab04027c40d5040fb2_2015.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2a27ea0a86c03b8be80_1999.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2ac04027c40d5040fb4_2016.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2a404027c40d5040faa_2005.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2a704027c40d5040fb0_2010.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2af7ea0a86c03b8be8a_2017.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2ac4e24360ddd552de7_2016.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/12/15/5a33f265f46871653c88d73f_justin-timberlake-will-smith-instagram.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2a404027c40d5040fab_1996.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2a74e24360ddd552de3_2011.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2a17ea0a86c03b8be7e_1995.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2a87ea0a86c03b8be84_2012.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/30/597dc2aa4e24360ddd552de5_2014.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/12/15/5a33f265f46871653c88d73f_justin-timberlake-will-smith-instagram.jpg?w=414&h=348&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/12/15/5a33f265f46871653c88d73f_justin-timberlake-will-smith-instagram.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/will-smith-instagram-justin-timberlake", "title": "Will Smith Is Welcomed to Instagram by Justin Timberlake", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@wmag", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/will-smith-instagram-justin-timberlake", "type": "article", "title": "Will Smith Finally Joins Instagram (With Some Help From Justin Timberlake)", "description": "The actor is new to #TBTs.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/12/15/5a33f265f46871653c88d73f_justin-timberlake-will-smith-instagram.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "description": "The actor is new to #TBTs."}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/txw965bK_lQ"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
