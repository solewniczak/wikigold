She tells Allure that not only is dotted liner a way of adding texture to your look in a nontraditional way, it is a \"comfortable step toward wearing something more daring than a classic liner. It can be as bold or as discreet as you'd like.\"\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWhat other makeup should you have on when you're wearing dot eyeliner?\n\nHughes recommends keeping the rest of your makeup low-key with a fresh face and groomed brows, so the dots don't look \"too theatrical.\" Instead, keeping your skin matte and your brows natural creates a perfect balance\u2014you know, kind of like a hamburger with salad, Hughes explains. She even compared the vibe you should go for to Alicia Keys's appearance on our February cover. As for lips, you have free reign to top with whatever color you want. \"It's like pairing black liner with any lip color,\" Hughes says. Greta Agazzi, a professional makeup artist based in Italy, agrees. She tells Allure that she's into the minimalist look because it gives her \"mime vibes.\" She's so right\u2014in the best way possible. You might not want to wear a black-and-white striped shirt, though. You know, just in case.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nFor Emma Robert's look, professional makeup artist Kara Yoshimoto Bua kept her look, which was inspired by Coco Chanel BTW, supersimple with neutral eye-shadow shades on the actress's lids. First, Bua smudged the taupe shade from the Tisse Camelia\n\nChanel Quadra Eyeshadow in Tiss\u00e9 Gabrielle An eye-shadow palette with four cool, shimmery gray-based shades\n\nonto the lower lash lines. Next, she brushed a shimmery brown onto the outer part of Roberts's upper lash line for \"soft, natural definition,\" Bua says. Then, Bua swept a champagne powder on Roberts's upper lids, inner eyes, and brow bones to give her a lit-from-within glow. (These Best of Beauty-winning products can help you get there, too.) Then, she finished off with the petal pink shade on Roberts's creases.\n\nAnd just how do you get those damn dots so precise?\n\nJust last week, Flirt Cosmetics launched the Dot Dot Dot Dual Ended Liner ($22), which makes things hella easier. One side has your classic felt-tipped liner. The other has a special dotting applicator. Revlon also has a ball-point liner that has literally a ball point. Both option create the perfect spots. Hughes and D'Angelo also suggest using the round end of a makeup brush. You can dip it into a black liquid lipstick (we like the one from Sephora Collection), gel liner or create your own mixture with some setting spray and black eye shadow like Hughes does. The latter lets you be \"in control of the consistency,\" Hughes says. \"A watery one works best.\"\n\nAs for placement, use your pupils for alignment. Then, create dots either right below your lower lash lines, like Roberts's look, or below the folds and fine lines of your undereye area. Agazzi likes to wear them almost on top of her cheeks, so don't afraid to stray from your waterlines. And remember, as D'Angelo says, 'Dot liner is fun, hard to mess up, and it washes off at the end of the day!'\"", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/5880dfa588083ccc3bd2b08e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/emma-roberts-dot-eyeliner.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/589cf2dad1f9dd0d0ceee827/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/pinnable-3-Dot-Eyeliner-Trend.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/58828054fd6e05e715a9737b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/dot%2520liner%2520comp.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/57e3d367d20277447bdad4fe/master/w_775%2Cc_limit/BREAKTHROUGHS%2520Chanel%2520Eyeshadow%2520in%2520Tisse%25CC%2581%2520Gabrielle.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/61bb3bd4f8ff9851ecae5517/master/h_120%2Cc_limit/allure_beauty_box_192_ticker.png", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5f063217cba9860008d6c18d/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/Devon-Abelman-Yulip-Lipstick-Gochujang.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5880dfa588083ccc3bd2b08e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/emma-roberts-dot-eyeliner.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Devon Abelman", "Fiona Gibb"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/dot-eyeliner-instagram-trend", "title": "The Dot Eyeliner Trend: Here's Exactly How to Pull It Off", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "We chatted with professional makeup artists about dot eyeliner, how to create precise circles, and what other makeup to pair the look with.", "id": "587ff50c4d2ce4e43c8d0471", "keywords": "emma roberts,eye liner,flirt cosmetics,revlon,chanel,pinterest", "news_keywords": "emma roberts,eye liner,flirt cosmetics,revlon,chanel,pinterest", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "587ff50c4d2ce4e43c8d0471", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"We chatted with professional makeup artists about dot eyeliner, how to create precise circles, and what other makeup to pair the look with.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5880dfa588083ccc3bd2b08e/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/emma-roberts-dot-eyeliner.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5880dfa588083ccc3bd2b08e/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/emma-roberts-dot-eyeliner.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Connect the dots.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5880dfa588083ccc3bd2b08e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/emma-roberts-dot-eyeliner.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "This Unexpected Eyeliner Trend Is About to Blow Up Instagram", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/dot-eyeliner-instagram-trend"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-01-23T13:00:00.000Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5880dfa588083ccc3bd2b08e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/emma-roberts-dot-eyeliner.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1485176400.0, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
