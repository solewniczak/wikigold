Bryan teamed with SmackDown Live Commissioner to culminate their angle with Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn. Bryan and McMahon gained the victory in New Orleans, and Bryan proceeded into full-time competition on the blue brand.\n\nAfter being cleared by several doctors, WWE still refused to give the go-ahead for Bryan to return to in-ring action. Bryan was instead given the role of General Manager, which he admitted that he hated coming to work while in this position. Bryan also made it clear on several interviews that he would compete elsewhere if he did not get cleared from WWE. After a tough conversation with Vince McMahon, Bryan agreed to get checked by trainers after every match to make sure that he does not have another concussion.\n\nBrie Bella, who encouraged Bryan throughout his injury, spoke to TVInsider to promote Total Bellas, and discussed how she feels about Bryan\u2019s health since returning to the ring.\n\n\u201cOne thing about Bryan is he is just so healthy and physically fit,\u201d said Brie. \u201cHe really knows what he can do. That\u2019s the one thing. I do trust him with the way he moves out there and his body and what he does. I\u2019m letting him live his dream and do what he wants because life is too short. There are times I watch and am like, \u2018Oh my.\u2019 At the end of the day though, he is great. He is super safe and super healthy.\u201d\n\nSee Also: Daniel Bryan Advertised For Major Show After His WWE Contract Expires\n\nBryan is not the only one who desired a WWE return, as Brie is interested in coming back as well.\n\n\u201cMy husband really wants us to get pregnant again. I tell him that in my heart I just really want to come back to have a main story,\u201d said Brie. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a month long or two months, six months. I would love that. I think about how much work one kid is. Bringing another in, I can\u2019t imagine. My sister and I are really pushing hard. We would both love to, especially since the last couple of years it was Nikki was there or I was there. The Bella Twins really haven\u2019t had a run since the \u2018Divas Revolution.'\u201d\n\nHowever, Brie will concede to Bryan\u2019s request to have another child if WWE does not have anything for her creatively.\n\n\u201cEven with the Mixed Match Challenge. I was like, \u2018Bryan, we should do it if it came back. Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing?\u2019 I\u2019m hoping,\u201d Brie said. \u201cI told him to give me until next summer. Let me see if I can do something before then. If the boss doesn\u2019t want us back by next summer, we can start trying for babies.\u201d\n\nAside from a tag team feud between The Bella Twins and the IIconics, Brie named Asuka and Alexa Bliss as two people she would like to wrestle. Brie did compete in the first ever women\u2019s Royal Rumble match this past January, entering at 28 and lasting nearly 12 minutes before getting eliminated by her sister Nikki.\n\nSource: TVInsider\n\nHave a news tip or correction?
