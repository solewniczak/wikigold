Also along for the watery ride was the singer\u2019s on-off backup dancer boyfriend Bryan Tanaka, who also shared a video of himself swimming with the bottom-dwelling sharks. The animals, which eat mainly small fish, shrimp and squid, can grow up to 14 feet (4.3 meters) and have very strong jaws filled with thousands of tiny, serrated teeth, which they use to bite defensively if stepped on or bothered by divers who assume they\u2019re docile.\n\nIn another picture which showed Mariah petting one of the sharks, the star looked stunning in a wetsuit unzipped to her cleavage. She also revealed her rarely seen adventurous side in a video of herself and Monroe snorkelling in the shallow water with the creatures.\n\n\u201cSwimming with sharks,\u201d Mariah she captioned the clip. \u201cPerfectly normal.\u201d", "images": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-circle-share.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/share-modal-icon-close.svg", "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297970550732_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=90&size=520x&strip=all&w=288&h=216", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/newsletters/logo/newsletter-envelope.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-fb.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-yt.svg", "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297970550732_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=520x", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-tw.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-rdit.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-li.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-tblr.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-circle-email.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-pin.svg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/pmd-stage-northamerica-northeast1-dcs-static-files/10.0.3/websites/images/share-icons/icon-soc-ig.svg"], "top_img": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297970550732_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=520x", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://torontosun.com/2017/07/05/mariah-carey-takes-twins-swimming-with-gentle-sharks", "title": "Mariah Carey takes twins swimming with 'gentle' sharks", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "description": "Mariah Carey took her twins Moroccan and Monroe on a daring day out to celebrate July 4 - swimming with sharks.", "google-site-verification": "kK9JgWClNj_xPmY-xEXJ8C95PgC_s3Ax12Qq6Wkqh88", "vf": {"container_id": "c2c8e557-e3fa-4658-96cd-0f56c5248dd6"}, "fb": {"pages": 189526659635, "app_id": 144435319507370}, "og": {"site_name": "torontosun", "type": "article", "title": "Mariah Carey takes twins swimming with 'gentle' sharks", "image": {"identifier": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297970550732_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=520x", "width": 520, "height": 780}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/torontosun/"}, "twitter": {"title": "Mariah Carey takes twins swimming with 'gentle' sharks", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297970550732_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=520x", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://torontosun.com/2017/07/05/mariah-carey-takes-twins-swimming-with-gentle-sharks?ia_markup=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499205600.0, "source": "https://torontosun.com", "summary": ""}
