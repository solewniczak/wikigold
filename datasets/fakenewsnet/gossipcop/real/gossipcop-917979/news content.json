Whether she wears a stop-and-stare jumpsuit or head-turning hairstyle, the 80-year-old actress (and 2018 Academy Awards presenter) isn\u2019t afraid to stand out. And she continued that bold style streak at the Oscars, arriving in a special Balmain gown that shows off her \u201cyouthful physique.\u201d\n\nFonda hit the carpet wearing a white long-sleeve beaded Balmain gown that\u2019s part of the brand\u2019s first \u201c44 Fran\u00e7ois premier \u201d collection.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cThis is the very first red carpet collection for Olivier Rousteing, honoring Mr. Balmain and the heritage of the house,\u201d her stylist, Tanya Gill tells PEOPLE. \u201cUsing all codes of Balmain, this collection was designed for celebrity friends of the house.\u201d\n\nWatch People & Entertainment Weekly Red Carpet Live this Sunday, March 4 at 5pm ET/2pm PT.

She says Fonda is \u201cconfident and being herself, not having to follow fashion for fashion\u2019s sake. This look us all about defining one\u2019s own style and totally owning it.\u201d\n\nAs far as Fonda\u2019s accessories, Gill was going for \u201cclassic with a twist\u201d and chose dangling drop earrings featuring over 25 carats worth of diamonds and a 2-carat oval-shaped ring (both Chopard).\n\nShe also carried a Perrin Paris clutch and wore a Time\u2019s Up pin to support the fight against sexual harassment and workplace inequality in the entertainment industry and beyond.\n\nThe 2018 Oscars ceremony will be held at the Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland Center on March 4 and will be televised live on ABC at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1231&h=616&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fjane-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fjane-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1231&h=616&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fjane-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colleen Kratofil", "March"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/oscars-2018-jane-fonda-white-balmain-gown/", "title": "Jane Fonda Shows Off 'Youthful Physique' in White Balmain Gown at the 2018 Oscars", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Academy Awards,Awards Shows,Jane Fonda,News,Red Carpet", "news_keywords": "Academy Awards,Awards Shows,Jane Fonda,News,Red Carpet", "description": "Jane Fonda's stylist, Tanya Gill, says the look is all about \"defining ones own style and totally owning it\"", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Jane Fonda Shows Off 'Youthful Physique' in White Balmain Gown at the 2018 Oscars", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/oscars-2018-jane-fonda-white-balmain-gown/", "description": "Jane Fonda's stylist, Tanya Gill, says the look is all about \"defining ones own style and totally owning it\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1231&h=616&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fjane-2000.jpg", "width": 1231, "height": 616}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/style/oscars-2018-jane-fonda-white-balmain-gown/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fjane-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/style/oscars-2018-jane-fonda-white-balmain-gown/", "title": "Jane Fonda Shows Off 'Youthful Physique' in White Balmain Gown at the 2018 Oscars", "description": "Jane Fonda's stylist, Tanya Gill, says the look is all about \"defining ones own style and totally owning it\"", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1231&h=616&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fjane-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/style/oscars-2018-jane-fonda-white-balmain-gown/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
