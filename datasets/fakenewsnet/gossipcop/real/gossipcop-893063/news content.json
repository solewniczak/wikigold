On Friday, Page told a few Ratner stories of her own in a lengthy Facebook post, detailing Ratner\u2019s alleged inappropriate behavior toward her.\n\nWhen she was 18 years old, the actress says that Ratner made a lewd joke about her sexuality during a cast and crew \u201cmeet and greet\u201d on the set of X-Men: The Last Stand. (Page played the character Kitty Pryde in the film.)\n\n\u201cYou should f--k her to make her realize she\u2019s gay,\u201d Ratner allegedly said to another woman in the group, Page writes. Page, who came out as a lesbian in 2014, says she felt \u201cviolated\u201d by his alleged remark. \u201cHe \u2018outed\u2019 me with no regard for my well-being, an act we all recognize as homophobic.\u201d\n\nShe continues: \u201cI proceeded to watch him on set say degrading things to women. I remember a woman walking by the monitor as he made a comment about her \u2018flappy pussy.\u2019\u201d\n\nActress Anna Paquin, who co-starred in the film, tweeted that she supported Page\u2019s claims. \u201cI was there when that comment was made. I stand with you,\u201d she wrote.\n\nRepresentatives for Ratner have not yet responded to Vanity Fair\u2019s request for comment about these claims.\n\nPage\u2019s Facebook post, however, is about much more than Ratner alone. The actress also discusses sexual abuse in the industry at large, sharing a story about a director who allegedly propositioned her during a dinner meeting when she was just 16 years old.\n\n\u201cHe fondled my leg under the table and said, \u2018You have to make the move, I can\u2019t.\u2019 I did not make the move and I was fortunate to get away from that situation,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt was a painful realization: my safety was not guaranteed at work.\u201d\n\nPage says she \u201cwas sexually assaulted by a grip months later. I was asked by a director to sleep with a man in his late twenties and to tell them about it. I did not. This is just what happened during my sixteenth year, a teenager in the entertainment industry.\u201d\n\nPage also points to other stars who have been accused of sexual abuse in the past, including Bill Cosby, Roman Polanski, and Harvey Weinstein. She then turns to Woody Allen, whom she worked with on the 2012 film To Rome with Love.\n\n\u201cI did a Woody Allen movie and it is the biggest regret of my career,\u201d she writes. \u201cI am ashamed I did this. I had yet to find my voice and was not who I am now and felt pressured, because \u2018of course you have to say yes to this Woody Allen film.\u2019 Ultimately, however, it is my choice what films I decide to do and I made the wrong choice. I made an awful mistake.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Allen\u2019s estranged daughter, Dylan Farrow, accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a child in an essay for The New York Times. He responded with an essay of his own, denying the allegations. The allegations that he sexually abused Farrow first surfaced publicly back in 1992. Allen has never been charged for these claims.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/545e2e1caa2a6274565a11c2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/545e2e1caa2a6274565a11da/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59fa27625f46de0ae14fce59/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Brett-Ratner-Hefner-Film-On-Hold.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a05ed1953badd5c35dd9af7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Ellen-Page-Ratner%202.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/545e2e1caa2a6274565a11de/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a05ed1953badd5c35dd9af7/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Ellen-Page-Ratner%25202.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f9d9dcf2a0957a1960aba2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Ratner-Seuxal-Misconduct%25202.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59fb3c66cc39e815449f92cc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Ratner-Suing-Accuser.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a05ed1953badd5c35dd9af7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Ellen-Page-Ratner%202.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Yohana Desta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/ellen-page-brett-ratner-facebook-post", "title": "Ellen Page Accuses Brett Ratner of \u201cHomophobic and Abusive Behavior\u201d", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "In a lengthy Facebook post, the actress accused the producer of allegedly outing her and making derogatory comments toward women.", "id": "5a05e27fe8216d6da983dc32", "keywords": "elliot page,brett ratner,weinstein,woody allen", "news_keywords": "elliot page,brett ratner,weinstein,woody allen", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a05e27fe8216d6da983dc32", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In a lengthy Facebook post, the actress accused the producer of allegedly outing her and making derogatory comments toward women.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a05ed1953badd5c35dd9af7/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Ellen-Page-Ratner%202.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a05ed1953badd5c35dd9af7/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Ellen-Page-Ratner%202.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "In a lengthy Facebook post, the actress accused the producer of allegedly outing her and making derogatory comments toward women.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a05ed1953badd5c35dd9af7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Ellen-Page-Ratner%202.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Ellen Page Accuses Brett Ratner of \u201cHomophobic and Abusive Behavior\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/ellen-page-brett-ratner-facebook-post"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-11-10T19:17:10.928Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a05ed1953badd5c35dd9af7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Ellen-Page-Ratner%202.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510341430.928, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
