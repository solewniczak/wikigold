{"url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-dating-glasses-celebrity-style", "text": "Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber are going strong. Over the weekend, the on-again couple jetted to Montego Bay, Jamaica, for Bieber\u2019s father Jeremy\u2019s wedding, where they were photographed hugging, kissing, and sharing meaningful glances. Now that these two are back stateside, it seems they still only have eyes for each other: When Gomez headed to the studio solo last night in Los Angeles, she brought a bit of her better half with her, courtesy of geek-chic Prada glasses that looked as if they could have been lifted from Bieber\u2019s closet. After all, the Biebz has been championing those very same nerdy specs for almost as long as he\u2019s been linked to Gomez.\n\nGomez balanced out her accessory\u2019s bookish vibes by going jock everywhere else, topping Zo\u00eb Jordan cashmere track pants with a RtA T-shirt embroidered with the phrase \u201cSummer 92,\u201d which happens to be when the 25-year-old Cancer was born. She laced into mid-height Puma sneakers, leaving her socks pulled up for a retro look, then strung a chintzy anklet around one foot (perhaps another accessory lovingly borrowed from from her chain-loving boyfriend?). Gomez had Givenchy\u2019s leather biker jacket in hand, which lent a sleek counterpoint to her sportswear, then packed on extra polish in the form of a Stalvey alligator bag. The next best arm candy would have been Bieber himself.\n\nSee this week\u2019s best dressed celebrities:", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a8a1c6f646cab687bcd1d7c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/03-best-dressed-celebrities-of-the-week.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.00b68c0d9934396a2a234f4f43427e3affd58e9b.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.02dcb2fef16d86c695ce8d290a3fd13c7f6c3182.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9041da1a71770bab842c36/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/holding-selena-gomez-celebrity-style.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.f2c4cf0289092a5686b7c6db87806b427e705af9.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9041e7966d3031b95ca0e6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/social-selena-gomez-celebrity-style.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a8a1c70f613120ba8eba330/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/02-best-dressed-celebrities-of-the-week.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a8a1c680eb2eb69430d0b92/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/01-best-dressed-celebrities-of-the-week.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9041e7966d3031b95ca0e6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/social-selena-gomez-celebrity-style.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Maria Ward"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-dating-glasses-celebrity-style", "title": "Is Selena Gomez Shopping Justin Bieber\u2019s Closet?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Selena Gomez only has eyes for Justin Bieber, quite literally.", "id": "5a9040e869ad9276fa55a1c2", "keywords": "selena gomez,justin bieber", "news_keywords": "selena gomez,justin bieber", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a9040e869ad9276fa55a1c2", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Selena Gomez only has eyes for Justin Bieber, quite literally.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9041de4650d478d14aaa5d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/square-selena-gomez-celebrity-style.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9041de4650d478d14aaa5d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/square-selena-gomez-celebrity-style.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Selena Gomez only has eyes for Justin Bieber, quite literally.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9041e7966d3031b95ca0e6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/social-selena-gomez-celebrity-style.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Is Selena Gomez Shopping Justin Bieber\u2019s Closet?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-dating-glasses-celebrity-style"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-02-23T16:30:00.000Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9041e7966d3031b95ca0e6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/social-selena-gomez-celebrity-style.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519403400.0, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
