My great-grandmother. Hers had the same placement as mine. My dad has one in his chin. And [my 7-year-old son] Flynn has one in his chin plus another on one side. Sometimes we\u2019ll do a little kiss where he puts his [dimple on] mine. It\u2019s quite cute because it\u2019s as if our dimples are kissing. I\u2019m surrounded by dimples\u2014even [my husband] Evan has one in his chin!\n\n[tiImage img-pos=\"2\" image_style=\"684xflex\" align=\"left\"]\n\nTHE FIRST TIME I GOT ATTENTION FOR MY DIMPLES... Was when I was growing up and someone [told] me that having dimples meant I was a flirt. I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that!\u201d Then, when I was modeling, people would comment that my dimples were cute. But I don\u2019t notice them much until I start laughing. That\u2019s when they come out.\n\nRELATED: What It's Like to Spend 24 Hours With Miranda Kerr\n\nMY ULTIMATE BEAUTY INDULGENCE... Is an at-home spa day. Between Flynn and [having a beauty line], it\u2019s easier to do treatments at home. Plus, I find I can get the same results. If I have someone come over to give me a body massage, I\u2019ll ask them to massage my face too. Then I\u2019ll use this little micro-dermabrasion machine I got really inexpensively on Amazon. After that I\u2019ll rub a few drops of my Noni Glow Face Oil between my palms and pat it all over. The nutrients sink in even deeper after you\u2019ve had a good exfoliation. Then I might follow that with a mask. It\u2019s like my own mini facial.\n\n[tiImage img-pos=\"1\" image_style=\"684xflex\" align=\"left\"]\n\nTHE BEST BEAUTY ADVICE I'VE EVER RECEIVED WAS... From my mum. Since I was a young girl, she\u2019s always told me, \u201cLet your little light shine.\u201d When people can really embrace that and shine from the inside and let their heart come through, that\u2019s what\u2019s so attractive and beautiful.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Is Amazon Prime Worth It?\n\nKerr's Must-Have Kit", "images":
