The biggest bombshell? Kardashian admitted that back in high school, she\u2019d use her school uniform skirt to score good grades.\n\nkim-kardsahian\n\n\u201cWe would wear uniforms, so I would wear this little skirt,\u201d the star said. \u201cI used to cheat on all of my tests. I would flip up the skirt and write all of the answers in washable ink. And what\u2019s the teacher gonna do? Ask you to lift up your skirt? Like, sexual harassment!\u201d\n\nWhen asked who has a better sense of style, Kardashian hands it to her husband: \u201cI mean, natural fashion sense? Probably him,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I\u2019ve learned to grow into it and learned to really love fashion. I\u2019d say it\u2019s like a tie now.\u201d\n\ncher-kim-kardashian Credit: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for AFI; Dominique Charriau/WireImage\n\nThe style influencer herself says she looks towards Cher, who she channeled on her recent Harper\u2019s Bazaar Arabia cover, for style inspiration. \u201cMy dream of life would be to look in her closet one day and just, I would die. I would die,\u201d Kardashian said.\n\nOne thing you might not be surprised to learn? The star\u2019s favorite body part: \u201cMy upper stomach, if that is even a thing,\u201d she said.\n\nkim-kardashian Credit: Kim Kardashian/Instagram", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fkim-kardsahian-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fkim-kardashian11.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F11%2F28%2FHeadshot-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fcher-kim-kardashian-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fkim-kardsahian-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fkim-kardsahian-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kaitlyn Frey", "September"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/kim-kardashian-ellen-degeneres-burning-questions/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Admits She Cheated On Her High School Tests By Writing The Answers Under Her Skirt", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Ellen,Ellen DeGeneres,Kim Kardashian,News", "news_keywords": "Ellen,Ellen DeGeneres,Kim Kardashian,News", "description": "The Keeping Up with the Kardashian star reveals how she cheated on all her high school exams and who her current style icon is", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Admits She Cheated On Her High School Tests By Writing The Answers Under Her Skirt", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/kim-kardashian-ellen-degeneres-burning-questions/", "description": "The Keeping Up with the Kardashian star reveals how she cheated on all her high school exams and who her current style icon is", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fkim-kardsahian-1.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/style/kim-kardashian-ellen-degeneres-burning-questions/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fkim-kardsahian-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/style/kim-kardashian-ellen-degeneres-burning-questions/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Admits She Cheated On Her High School Tests By Writing The Answers Under Her Skirt", "description": "The Keeping Up with the Kardashian star reveals how she cheated on all her high school exams and who her current style icon is", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fkim-kardsahian-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/style/kim-kardashian-ellen-degeneres-burning-questions/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Cn0-CwintU"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
