She has access to the same Internet as the rest of us; you know, that same Internet where trolls occasionally make rude comments about her and her friends. So it would not be a surprise for Hadid to come across one of these comments, and decide to weigh in. That\u2019s apparently what happened in a story involving Hadid, an Instagram fan account that\u2019s on her radar, and a (maybe?) now repentant troll.\n\nThe story begins with fan account @BallaHadid, one of the largest Hadid tribute accounts on Instagram with 26.7k followers. It seems to be on Hadid\u2019s radar. While she doesn\u2019t follow the account, its bio proclaims \u201cBella liked x3 commented x1 Hails liked x1.\u201d (We\u2019re assuming the \u201cHails\u201d is Hailey Baldwin). Over the weekend, the account posted a side-by-side photo of Hadid and her friend and fellow it-girl Kendall Jenner in semi-sheer, \u201cfree the nipple\u201d-type tops. \u201cKenny or Bella?\u201d it asked.\n\n[#Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg_dympBZ0S/?taken-by=ballahadid]\n\nOne user decided that the answer to the question was a decided neither and went in on both of the models. \u201c2 fake bitches sitting in a tree, first comes the nose job, then come the lips, oh and don\u2019t forget the built in cheeks,\u201d wrote the user. \u201clmao y\u2019all tripping fam, money can get you a new face but not a nicer personality which these two girls need.\u201d\n\nHadid saw the comment and decided to comment. Mind you, this all happened on the weekend following the release of an EP from her ex-boyfriend, The Weeknd, that appears to contain several references to their former relationship. Would not any of us in that position feel the need to let off a little steam and let the haters know what\u2019s what? Besides, even with all the (often baseless) rumors out there flying about Hadid and her life, there are none that suggest she has anything but a rather pleasant and chill personality. The modeling industry is full of tall tales of diva behavior, that\u2019s for sure, but none of them point back to Hadid.\n\n\u201cI wish you would know either of our personalities,\u201d wrote Hadid. \u201cAnd not only that, I wish you would only grasp a heart of your own. Blessings to you sweetheart. Jealousy is a cry for help that I wish I could help you with.\u201d\n\nFeel free to use \u201cBlessings to you sweetheart\u201d as your go-to response to any negative you should encounter in your own life.\n\nThe user deleted the comment, and, with it, Hadid\u2019s reply as well, but the fan account screenshotted the interaction and put it up on Instagram stories.\n\nWhat does remain on the post is the troll\u2019s reply to the incident. Apparently, they had a change of heart. Better living through getting clapped back at by a supermodel?\n\nAs it turned out, it seems the troll also became the victim of trolls and had to temporarily put their Instagram account on lockdown to weather the storm.\n\nThis is not the first time a model has clapped back at her trolls. Cara Delevingne is a master at it and once got in a memorable row with a Twitter user who told her to get a real job. Hadid\u2019s sister Gigi also recently took to Twitter to remind people that even supermodels sometimes read the comment sections. Clearly.\n\nRelated: How Bella Hadid Ruled the World in 2017", "images":
