Another member of Cal Fire also stands close by.\n\nThe Hill Fire, as it has been named in California, is estimated to be around 1,500 acres in size, according to KSBY. Two fires were initially reported in the area, but later merged into one as the state\u2019s fire season ramps up.\n\nNearly 250 people were evacuated from their homes on Monday night, KSBY reported. All roads leading to the area of the fire were closed.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to all in the area who are also experiencing loss from this vicious fire, the threat of which we live with constantly, which may seem crazy to some but we do so because living in our beautiful, rural area makes it worthwhile,\u201d he said in a statement to TMZ (which first reported the news).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never the structures that create a community \u2014 it\u2019s the people. And if the people of Santa Margarita have taught me anything it\u2019s that, once the smoke has cleared, literally and figuratively, it\u2019s a time to reach out and rebuild,\u201d he continued.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=750&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F06%2Fjohnny-galecki2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=750&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F06%2Fjohnny-galecki2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone", "June"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/big-bang-theory-johnny-galecki-thanks-firefighters-after-home-burns-down-fire/", "title": "Johnny Galecki Thanks Firefighters After His Home Burns Down in Massive Fire", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Johnny Galecki,News,The Big Bang Theory", "news_keywords": "Johnny Galecki,News,The Big Bang Theory", "description": "The Big Bang Theory star's vacation home burned down in a fire on Monday", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Johnny Galecki Thanks Firefighters After His Home Burns Down in Massive Fire", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/big-bang-theory-johnny-galecki-thanks-firefighters-after-home-burns-down-fire/", "description": "The Big Bang Theory star's vacation home burned down in a fire on Monday", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=750&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F06%2Fjohnny-galecki2.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 750}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/big-bang-theory-johnny-galecki-thanks-firefighters-after-home-burns-down-fire/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F06%2Fjohnny-galecki2.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/big-bang-theory-johnny-galecki-thanks-firefighters-after-home-burns-down-fire/", "title": "Johnny Galecki Thanks Firefighters After His Home Burns Down in Massive Fire", "description": "The Big Bang Theory star's vacation home burned down in a fire on Monday", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=750&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F06%2Fjohnny-galecki2.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/big-bang-theory-johnny-galecki-thanks-firefighters-after-home-burns-down-fire/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
