Yet, it\u2019s such a simple step \u2013 nestling neatly between your toner and moisturiser, these potent formulas do so much more than a regular moisturiser.\n\nGiven the strength and density of the crucial ingredients in their make-up, they can perform skin-saving miracles \u2013 targeting fine lines, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, dark spots and dullness \u2013 to ultimately achieve a more youthful look.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to look for serums with ingredients rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Serums with these tend to offer a more natural attempt at plumping, firming, and stimulating collagen production. It\u2019s also worth looking out for green tea, berries and marine-inspired skincare.\n\nWe also recommend using products that contain hyaluronic acid and retinol. The former not only hydrates the skin but simultaneously adds a smoothing and plumping effect, while the latter is considered the best anti-ageing ingredient around.\n\nRead more:\n\nRetinol gets to work on the surface of the skin, focusing on skintone and texture, as well as going deeper and stimulating cell renewal. However, exercise caution as those with sensitive or dry skin might find this causes irritation or flakiness.\n\nYou should also pay close attention to the texture of your serum. The lighter and faster to absorb it is, the easier it will be to add into your skincare routine. Plus, for those who have sensitive or oily skin, having a lighter-weight serum will definitely be a bonus as you\u2019ll want to minimise the feeling of the products you\u2019re piling on your face.\n\nStill, with so many brands putting their best foot forward, it\u2019s hard to know which is the best. So, we\u2019ve narrowed it down to the top 14, taking into account the different skincare anti-ageing concerns that each serum addressed.\n\nThe best anti-ageing serums of 2022 are:\n\nBest overall
