Snoop Dogg hosts.\n\nDirector Richard Linklater's first feature in three years (following a rare misfire, Where'd You Go, Bernadette) is also his first animated film since 2006's A Scanner Darkly. The semi-autobiographical film is set during the first moon landing in the summer of 1969 as that momentous event is viewed through two very different perspectives: that of the astronauts themselves (along with Mission Control), and another from the viewpoint of a young kid in Houston who is inspired by watching the landing on TV. The best-known names in the ensemble cast include Jack Black and Zachary Levi.\n\nBarbarians Trailer Thriller ($) Rent\n\nThe Boarding School: Las Cumbres Trailer Foreign/Drama Prime Video\n\nBoon Action ($) Rent/Buy\n\nNot an April Fools joke despite an early trailer that certainly suggests it is, The Bubble is both writer-director Judd Apatow's first Netflix project as well as his first film since The King of Staten Island. His new comedy, co-written by South Park veteran Pam Brady, follows the cast of an effects-driven action blockbuster (\"Cliff Beasts 6: The Battle for Everest\") as they shoot the film inside a pandemic-necessitated bubble and live together in a hotel. (Think of it as Tristram Shandy but with more PPE and more CGI dinosaurs.) The large ensemble cast includes Leslie Mann, Pedro Pascal, David Duchovny, Karen Gillan, Keegan-Michael Key, Fred Armisen, Rob Delaney, Peter Serafinowicz, and Maria Bakalova. (Don't confuse it with the similarly titled Netflix anime film Bubble, which also debuts this month.)\n\nCaptain Nova Foreign/Family/Sci-fi\n\n\u25a3 The Contractor Trailer Thriller ($) Rent\n\nDoug Unplugs Animation/Family Apple TV+\n\nFast & Furious Presents Law & Order: Chicago: Live!

All six episodes stream today, and the series, a BBC co-production, has already been renewed for a second season following positive reviews for the show's UK debut last fall.\n\n\u25a3 Slow Horses Trailer Drama Apple TV+\n\nOpening with a six-episode first season (and there will be at least one additional season, which has already been filmed), this British spy drama is an adaptation of the acclaimed 2010 novel of the same name by Mike Herron that kicked off an ongoing series of books. Like those books, Apple's series revolves around Slough House, a low-level division of MI5 that houses agents who have been discarded after making costly mistakes and hitting a career dead end. Gary Oldman stars (in his first regular TV role) as Slough House chief Jackson Lamb alongside Kristin Scott Thomas, Jonathan Pryce, Olivia Cooke, and Jack Lowden.

The 10-episode crime drama is indeed set in Tokyo but is loosely based on American journalist Jake Adelstein\u2019s memoir chronicling his work covering the Tokyo Metropolitan Police beat for a Japanese newspaper in the late 1990s. In the first TV role of his career, Ansel Elgort stars as Adelstein opposite Ken Watanabe, Rachel Keller, and Rinko Kikuchi. The adaptation comes from playwright J.T. Rogers (best known for the Tony-winning Oslo), while other producers include Destin Daniel Cretton and John Lesher. A co-production between Japan's WOWWOW and HBO Max, Tokyo Vice begins with three episodes today followed by two new episodes the following two Thursdays and a three-episode finale on April 28.\n\nFRI / April 8\n\nChris Pine, Thandiwe Newton, Laurence Fishburne, and Jonathan Pryce star in a thriller (also in theaters today) about an investigation to uncover the identity of a CIA mole.\n\nAs They Made Us Trailer Drama ($) Rent\n\nCoast Drama ($) Rent\n\n\u25a3 Cow Trailer Documentary ($) Rent\n\nMaking a simultaneous VOD and theatrical debut today nearly a year after premiering at Cannes, American Honey director Andrea Arnold's first documentary feature offers an intimate portrait of the life of a dairy cow named Luma.

Jordan among its producers. Chicago's criminal justice system is at the center of a story that finds a black high school athlete the target of both police and prosecutors bent on avenging the death of a cop during a drug bust gone wrong.

Kelley's first Netflix series (and there will be more) is an anthology that focuses on one story per season. Co-created by Kelley with Melissa James Gibson (House of Cards), this six-episode debut season is both a psychological thriller and courtroom drama adapted from the Sarah Vaughan novel of the same name, which focuses on a sexual consent scandal within Britain's privileged class that results in the trial of a politician. Sienna Miller, Rupert Friend, Michelle Dockery, and Maomi Scott head the cast, while S.J.

At first glance, it appears to be, with Josh Brolin starring as a rancher in Wyoming in a setting seemingly pulled straight out of that Paramount neo-western hit and storylines that touch on family drama and land disputes. But Outer Range quickly introduces a supernatural element that is unlike anything in that competing series. Imogen Poots, Lili Taylor, and Matt Lauria also star.\n\n\u25a3 Roar Anthology/Comedy/Drama Apple TV+\n\nApple's new darkly comedic episodic anthology series comes from GLOW creators Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch and is adapted from a 2019 book of short stories\u2014modern-day fables centering on women\u2014by Cecelia Ahern.

Roosevelt), Aaron Eckhart (as Gerald Ford), O-T Fagbenle (as Barack Obama), Dakota Fanning, Judy Greer, Lily Rabe, Kathleen Garrett, Isiah Williams, and Rhys Wakefield. The series comes from author Aaron Cooley and is directed in its entirety by Susanne Bier (The Undoing).

The Los Angeles Lakers great is the focus of a four-part Apple series from director Rick Famuyiwa that looks at his legendary playing career (which included championships in high school, in college at Michigan State, and with USA Basketball's first \"Dream Team\" in the 1992 Olympics) and also spends a considerable chunk of time on his busy life off the court. Johnson won five NBA championships with the Lakers in the 1980s, and those high-scoring \"Showtime\" years are also chronicled in HBO's recent drama miniseries Winning Time in which Quincy Isaiah portrays Magic for director Adam McKay.\n\nWriter-director Jane Schoenbrun\u2019s narrative feature debut follows Casey (newcomer Anna Cobb), a teenager who becomes immersed in an online role-playing horror game called the World\u2019s Fair Challenge. Many critics gave the unusual, genre-blending film high marks when it screened at Sundance over a year ago.\n\nSAT / April 23\n\nGreed: A Seven Deadly Sins Story Drama Lifetime, 8p\n\nA Tail of Love Drama Hallmark, 8p\n\nSUN / April 24\n\nThe Baby Trailer Horror/Comedy 10:30p\n\nCo-produced by the UK's Sky, this eight-episode, darkly comedic horror series stars Michelle De Swarte (The Duchess) as a 38-year-old woman who has no interest in joining her friends in motherhood. But when she very suddenly becomes a mother anyway, it's even worse than she imagained, thanks to the small fact that her baby appears to be evil, manipulative, violent, and supernatural. The series comes from Sian Robins-Grace (Sex Education) and Lucy Gaymer (Gangs of London).\n\n\u25a3 Barry Comedy 10p\n\nThe third season of HBO's Emmy-winning hit-man comedy finally launches tonight, nearly three full years after its previous episode aired.\n\nBilly the Kid Trailer Drama Epix, tbd\n\n\u25a3 Gaslit Trailer Drama Starz, tbd\n\nAdapted from season one of the Slate podcast \"Slow Burn,\" the Sam Esmail-produced Gaslit retells the story of the Watergate scandal with an emphasis on some of the lesser known figures involved. (In theory, it's yet another anthology series, with yet-to-be-ordered future seasons to focus on other events.) The star-filled cast includes Julia Roberts (as socialite Martha Mitchell), Sean Penn (as Attorney General John Mitchell), Dan Stevens (as John Dean), Betty Gilpin (as Mo Dean), Shea Whigham (as G. Gordon Liddy), Allison Tolman (as journalist Winnie McLendon), Patton Oswalt (as Nixon advisor Chuck Colson), Hamish Linklater (as Mitchell assistant Jeb Magruder), Chris Bauer (as Watergate burglar James McCord), Nat Faxon (as Bob Haldeman), Chris Messina (as FBI agent Angelo Lano), and J.C. MacKenzie (as E. Howard Hunt). The adaptation comes from writer/producer Robbie Pickering (a veteran of both Mr. Robot and Search Party). With the Watergate break-in nearing its 50th anniversary, you can expect more Watergate-themed content to come in the near future, including HBO's The White House Plumbers miniseries (which will find Woody Harrelson and Justin Theroux starring as Hunt and Liddy, respectively).\n\nHome Town Kickstart Reality HGTV, 8p\n\nOriginally developed for Paramount+ (but literally traded to Showtime in exchange for the recent Halo series), this new series from recent Star Trek veterans Alex Kurtzman and Jenny Lumet is set in the present and is loosely based both on the cult classic 1976 movie and the Walter Tevis novel that inspired it. Chiwetel Ejiofor stars\u2014effectively in the role played by David Bowie in the original film, though it's an entirely new character named Faraday\u2014as an alien who arrives on Earth at a key point in human history. Naomi Harris plays the scientist who befriends him and carries the burden of saving her planet\u2014and the alien's. Rob Delaney, Jimmi Simpson, Kate Mulgrew, Clarke Peters, Sonya Cassidy, Joana Ribeiro, and Bill Nighy also star, with the latter actually playing Bowie's character, Thomas Newton, who in this series is an earlier alien visitor to Earth. Two episodes air back-to-back tonight.\n\nThree Busy Debras Trailer Comedy Adult Swim, midnight\n\nEach episode this season will also be available to stream (the same day it airs) on HBO Max, where the previous season, which aired two years ago, is also now streaming.\n\nMON / April 25\n\nWe Own This City Drama tbd\n\nIt's a perfect marriage of subject matter and filmmaker. For his latest HBO miniseries, David Simon returns to the streets of Baltimore, the location for several of his previous series including The Wire and The Corner. Directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green (King Richard) and co-created by novelist George Pelecanos (a frequent Simon collaborator who also wrote for The Wire), and adapted from the nonfiction book by Baltimore Sun journalist Justin Fenton, the six-episode We Own This City chronicles the rise and fall of the Baltimore Police Department's Gun Trace Task Force, a rogue and corrupt division that was eventually the target of a federal investigation. Jon Bernthal heads a cast that also includes Wunmi Mosaku, Josh Charles, McKinley Belcher III, Dagmara Domi\u0144czyk, Treat Williams, and some familiar faces for Wire fans including Jamie Hector, Darrell Britt-Gibson, Domenick Lombardozzi, and Anwan Glover.\n\nWED / April 27\n\nSilverton Siege Action/Thriller\n\n\u25a3 The Survivor Drama 8p\n\nBen Foster stars as Auschwitz survivor Harry Haft\u2014who was forced by the Nazis to battle his fellow prisoners in gladiatorial boxing matches and later, following the war, returns to boxing as a way to reclaim his life\u2014in this true-story drama directed by Barry Levinson. Vicky Krieps, Peter Sarsgaard, Billy Magnussen, John Leguizamo, and Danny DeVito also star. Reviews out of TIFF last fall were solid if unspectacular, but good enough to make The Survivor Levinson's best-reviewed movie in a decade.\n\nTHU / April 28\n\n\u25a3 Bubble Trailer Anime\n\nThis sci-fi anime feature from the team behind Attack on Titan is set in a Tokyo where the laws of gravity no longer apply.\n\nHaving run out of titles to remake (well, not really), Hollywood is now turning to making content about making content. So how does the idea of a 10-episode series dramatizing the making of The Godfather grab you (when, for about a third of the time investment, you could just watch the film instead)? The series comes from Michael Tolkin (The Player) and Nikki Toscano (Hunters) and stars Dan Fogler as director Francis Ford Coppola, Patrick Gallo as author Mario Puzo, Matthew Goode as legendary producer and Paramount head Robert Evans, Miles Teller as Godfather producer Albert S. Ruddy, plus Juno Temple, Colin Hanks, and Giovanni Ribisi. Three episodes debut today followed by one additional episode each Thursday.\n\nUnder the Banner of Heaven Drama\n\nOscar winner Dustin Lance Black (Milk) adapts the nonfiction book by Jon Krakauer into a seven-episode, FX-produced miniseries that launches with its first two episodes today. The true-crime series focuses on the events leading up to the 1984 murder of a Utah woman (Normal People's Daisy Edgar-Jones) and her baby daughter by a pair of Mormon fundamentalists. Andrew Garfield also stars as the detective who investigates the case and finds his own Mormon faith shaken by what he discovers.\n\nThe Way Down: God, Greed and The Cult of Gwen Shamblin Documentary HBO Max\n\nFRI / April 29\n\nBushwick Bill: Geto Boy Documentary/Music 8p\n\n\u25a3 Hatching Trailer Horror ($) Rent\n\nOzark Drama\n\nShining Girls Trailer Drama/Sci-fi Apple TV+\n\nElisabeth Moss heads the cast of an eight-episode adaptation of the creepy 2013 novel The Shining Girls by Lauren Beukes. Also starring Wagner Moura, Jamie Bell, Phillipa Soo, and Amy Brenneman, the series centers on a Chicago reporter (Moss) who survives a brutal assault but uncovers an unsettling truth about her attacker: He's a time-traveling serial killer. The adaptation comes from Silka Luisa (Strange Angel) and features an all-woman directing corps made up of Michelle MacLaren (Breaking Bad), Daina Reid (The Handmaid's Tale) and Moss herself. Three episodes stream today followed by single-episode weekly installments.", "images": ["https://static.metacritic.com/images/features/networks/cbs20.png",
