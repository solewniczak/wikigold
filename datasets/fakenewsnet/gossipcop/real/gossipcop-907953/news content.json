She also added Anthony Rapp, after Tomei mentioned the actor as well. \u201cAll of you,\u201d Tomei concluded, \u201cthank you.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-908523566-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-908523566-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-908523566-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shirley Li", "January", "At Pm Est"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/sag-awards/2018/01/21/rosanna-arquette-marisa-tomei-sag-awards-silence-breakers/", "title": "Rosanna Arquette, Marisa Tomei thank 'silence breakers' at SAG Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Marisa Tomei,Rosanna Arquette", "news_keywords": "Marisa Tomei,Rosanna Arquette", "description": "Rosanna Arquette, herself a voice who spoke out against Harvey Weinstein, thanked 'silence breakers' alongside Marisa Tomei at the 2018 SAG Awards", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Rosanna Arquette, Marisa Tomei thank 'silence breakers' at SAG Awards", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/sag-awards/2018/01/21/rosanna-arquette-marisa-tomei-sag-awards-silence-breakers/", "description": "Rosanna Arquette, herself a voice who spoke out against Harvey Weinstein, thanked 'silence breakers' alongside Marisa Tomei at the 2018 SAG Awards", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-908523566-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/sag-awards/2018/01/21/rosanna-arquette-marisa-tomei-sag-awards-silence-breakers/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-908523566-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/sag-awards/2018/01/21/rosanna-arquette-marisa-tomei-sag-awards-silence-breakers/", "title": "Rosanna Arquette, Marisa Tomei thank 'silence breakers' at SAG Awards", "description": "Rosanna Arquette, herself a voice who spoke out against Harvey Weinstein, thanked 'silence breakers' alongside Marisa Tomei at the 2018 SAG Awards", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-908523566-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/sag-awards/2018/01/21/rosanna-arquette-marisa-tomei-sag-awards-silence-breakers/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516489200.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
