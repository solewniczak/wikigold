This is unacceptable sexism. No woman deserves this,\u201d she added. \u201cThank you for using your platform to raise awareness for the issue of prison reform, Kim.\u201d\n\nWashington Post columnist Karen Tumulty added, \u201cCan we just stand back for a moment and acknowledge the sexism of this headline? @KimKardashian is far from the first celebrity to understand the power of using her spotlight to call attention to a serious issue.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump Jr. also weighed in on the cover, claiming that if Kardashian West had this meeting when former president Barack Obama was in office, \u201cit would have been lauded.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian Rocks a Power Suit for White House Meetings About Prison Reform\n\n\u201cHate to always have to point out the obvious but you never got this kind of hate [when] Obama did his parading of celebs through The White House. When he did it they were all amazingly subject matter experts. Why the continued double standard?\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cHere a woman @Kim Kardashian who happens to be a celeb has spent years on one case researching it, funding legal defense funds, but because she met with @realdonaldtrump about the issue that she\u2019s taken very seriously, she\u2019s mocked and criticized,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe BS from the media and left wing agenda just really needs to stop.\u201d\n\nAfter calling attention to Kardashian West\u2019s previous political work in advocating for gun control and Planned Parenthood, journalist Yashar Ali claimed that he was told the KKW Beauty mogul\u2019s decision not to smile in the photograph documenting her visit with Trump \u201cwas intentional.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Today is for you.\u201d\n\nAlice Marie Johnson Kim KardashianCredit: Kim Kardashian/Instagram Credit: Kim Kardashian/Instagram\n\nThe mother of three shared the same comment on Twitter in honor of Johnson, who was incarcerated in October 1996 after she helped facilitate communications in a drug trafficking case.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank President Trump for his time this afternoon. It is our hope that the President will grant clemency to Ms. Alice Marie Johnson who is serving a life sentence for a first-time, non-violent drug offense,\u201d she later tweeted.\n\n\u201cWe are optimistic about Ms. Johnson\u2019s future and hopeful that she \u2014and so many like her\u2014will get a second chance at life,\u201d she wrote in a follow-up tweet.\n\nIn a personal essay published on CNN earlier this month, Johnson opened up about what Kardashian West\u2019s help has meant to her, including the spotlight that has been placed on her case.\n\n\u201cSome refer to prison as a place where hope dies. Some days I\u2019ve found that to be almost right,\u201d Johnson wrote. \u201cEach time that I\u2019ve come close [to giving up], God has restored my faith.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fkim-kardashian-donald-trump-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fkim-kardashian-donald-trump-2-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fkim-kardashian-donald-trump-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "May"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/new-york-post-kim-kardashian-donald-trump-outrage/", "title": "New York Post's Kim Kardashian Trump Meeting Cover Sparks Outrage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Donald Trump,Kardashians,Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Kim Kardashian,News,Politics", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump,Kardashians,Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Kim Kardashian,News,Politics", "description": "The New York Post sparked outrage after sharing a photo of an upcoming cover commenting Kim Kardashian West's meeting with Donald Trump", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "New York Post's 'Trump Meets Rump' Cover Sparks Outrage Over 'Sexist' Depiction of Kim Kardashian", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/new-york-post-kim-kardashian-donald-trump-outrage/", "description": "The New York Post sparked outrage after sharing a photo of an upcoming cover commenting Kim Kardashian West's meeting with Donald Trump", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fkim-kardashian-donald-trump-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/new-york-post-kim-kardashian-donald-trump-outrage/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fkim-kardashian-donald-trump-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/new-york-post-kim-kardashian-donald-trump-outrage/", "title": "New York Post's 'Trump Meets Rump' Cover Sparks Outrage Over 'Sexist' Depiction of Kim Kardashian", "description": "The New York Post sparked outrage after sharing a photo of an upcoming cover commenting Kim Kardashian West's meeting with Donald Trump", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fkim-kardashian-donald-trump-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/new-york-post-kim-kardashian-donald-trump-outrage/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
