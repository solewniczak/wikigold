Between their flirtatious first meeting, romantic Valentine's Day proposal and epic pregnancy announcement, here is everything you need to know about Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom's relationship.\n\nKaty Perry and Orlando Bloom first met at a Golden Globes after-party in 2016 and immediately hit it off. After a year of dating, the couple called their relationship quits, but later reconciled.\n\nOrlando proposed on Valentine's Day in 2019 with a unique ruby engagement ring.\n\nOn March 4, 2020, Katy revealed she was pregnant with Orlando's child in her latest music video for \"Never Worn White.\"\n\nThe couple welcomed their first daughter on August 26, 2020, naming her Daisy Dove Bloom.\n\nJanuary 10, 2016: A Flirty Encounter\n\nGetty Images\n\nKaty and Orlando met for the first time at a Golden Globes after-party in 2016. According to onlookers, the two were acting quite flirty and even left the event together.\n\nApril 2016: From the Mountains to the Valley\n\nBy April 2016, it was pretty clear that the singer and the movie star were an item since they attended a wedding together in Aspen, Colorado and the music festival, Coachella, back-to-back weekends.\n\nMay 20, 2016: Instagram Official\n\nThe American Idol judge finally confirmed her relationship with Bloom by posting a photo of the pair on Instagram. The duo was in Cannes, France together for the Cannes Film Festival and Katy shared a snap of the two dressed in robes, lying on the grand stairs outside a mansion with the clever caption, \"we cannes't.\"\n\nAugust 4, 2016: Those Paddleboarding Pics\n\nThe paparazzi pictures of their Italian holiday in the summer of 2016 will probably live in infamy. Not only did they ride a paddleboard together in the Mediterranean, but Bloom paddled completely naked. The best part? Katy seemed unbothered by her boyfriend baring it all behind her.\n\nOctober 31, 2016: Couple's Costume\n\nIn the spirit of the 2016 presidential election, Katy and Orlando took their relationship to the next level by dressing as Hillary and Bill Clinton for a star-studded Halloween party. The couple spared no expense dressing in realistic prosthetics, with Katy rocking a red pantsuit. They even hired someone to follow them around the party dressed as a \"Trump troll.\" One point for creativity!\n\nNovember 24, 2016: He's Part of the Family\n\nAfter less than a year of dating, Orlando was invited to celebrate Thanksgiving with Katy and her family. He fit right in with the Perrys, even wearing festive holiday pajamas with the rest of the family, which Katy fortunately documented on Instagram.\n\nMarch 1, 2017: Calling It Quits\n\nIn March 2017, they called their relationship quits. \"Before rumors or falsifications get out of hand we can confirm that Orlando and Katy are taking respectful, loving space at this time,\" their reps said in a statement, per E! News. According to sources, their split was mutual and the pair remained friends.\n\nAugust 11, 2017: Back Together Again?\n\nBut, Orlando and Katy's break-up was seemingly short-lived after they were spotted attending an Ed Sheeran concert together in Los Angeles. The Daily Mail published photos of the pair acting very cuddly and a source even told E! News \"they definitely seemed like they're back together.\"\n\nJanuary 2018: Reconciliation in the Maldives\n\nBy the beginning of 2018, it appeared the couple was giving their relationship another shot. They celebrated the new year with a luxurious vacation to the Maldives as reconciliation rumors raged on.\n\nFebruary 28, 2018: Perry in Prague\n\nThe singer visited her beau in Prague while Bloom was filming his Amazon Prime series Carnival Row. A source told People, \"In the past few months, they have spent a lot of time together. They both love traveling and are trying to share as many fun trips as possible. They are dating, but not necessarily putting a label on it. They are not girlfriend and boyfriend. They do seem very happy together though. Orlando always had the nicest things to say about Katy. He loves spending time with her.\u201d\n\nMary 21, 2018: \"I'm Not Single\"\n\nIn a very awkward moment, Katy confirmed she was no longer single on an episode of American Idol. \"Can I be in the running?\" Katy asked former Bachelorette Becca Kufrin, who was on air to promote her upcoming season of The Bachelorette. \"I'm not single but I still like you,\" the judge went on to say. While Perry never explicitly said that Orlando was the one who had her heart, their love affair was pretty clear!\n\nSeptember 26, 2018: Red Carpet Debut\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhile the couple had been photographed together before, they had yet to walk a red carpet as a pair until September 2016. They attended the Gala for the Global Ocean in Monte Carlo together and looked absolutely smitten.\n\nFebruary 14, 2019: A Valentine's Day Engagement\n\nOrlando proposed to Katy on Valentine's Day in 2019. He chose a very unique flower-shaped ruby engagement ring to gift his fianc\u00e9e. The night started with dinner at an Italian restaurant before the couple boarded a helicopter (yes, he proposed in the sky!). When they later landed on a roof, the newly-engaged couple was greeted by family, friends and dozens of flowers.\n\nFebruary 20, 2019: Engagementmoon in the Mountains\n\nA week after they became fianc\u00e9s, the couple hit the slopes for an engagementmoon. They shared snaps of their ski trip on Instagram with Orlando writing, \"Underneath, we\u2019re grinning from ear to ear.\" Katy jokingly commented, \"Tag me so I don\u2019t like look a random.\"\n\nJune 6, 2019: No Rush to the Altar\n\nWhile appearing on KISS Breakfast With Tom & Daisy, the \"Roar\" singer told the radio hosts she was in no rush to walk down the aisle. \u201cWell yeah, one step at a time. Definitely, you know, trying to, like, lay the good emotional foundation for the lifetime of commitment, which is, like, a big deal, you know?\u201d\n\nMarch 4, 2020: The Pregnancy Announcement\n\nWhen Katy dropped her music video for her newest single \"Never Worn White,\" she also dropped another bombshell\u2014she's pregnant! At the end of the music video, Katy is seen cradling her growing baby bump. The song also pays homage to her romance with Orlando with lyrics like, \"Cause I've never worn white/But I wanna get it right/Yeah, I really wanna try with you/No, I've never worn white/But I'm standin' here tonight/Cause I really wanna say 'I do.'\"\n\nMarch 5, 2020: Postponing the Wedding\n\nJust a day after announcing their pregnancy, news broke that the couple postponed their March wedding due to the pandemic. Katy and Orlando were planning to tie the knot in Japan but were forced to put their nuptials on hold.\n\nApril 3, 2020: A Sweet Gender Reveal\n\nNearly a month after the couple announced they were expecting, they took to Instagram to share the baby's gender! \"It's a girl,\" wrote Katy on Instagram, underneath a photo of Orlando covered in pink frosting.\n\nAugust 26, 2020: Welcome to the World, Daisy Dove Bloom!\n\nOn August 26, 2020, Katy and Orlando gave birth to their first child and named her Daisy Dove Bloom. \"We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter,\" the new parents said on Instagram. It seems as though the couple had baby Daisy's name finalized long before her birth. The Instagram photo showed off the new mother's daisy manicure as a sweet nod to the little one. Plus, the singer released a song titled \"Daisies\" in May, which was a clear hint to her young daughter's name!\n\nThe birth announcement was originally made by UNICEF since both Katy and Orlando are Goodwill Ambassadors. The singer and actor took the arrival of their daughter as an opportunity to spread UNICEF's message\u2014even creating a donation page on behalf of Baby Bloom. The couple revealed, \"In celebration of the heart we know our daughter already has, we have set up a donation page to celebrate DDB\u2019s arrival. By supporting them, you are supporting a safe start to life and reimagining a healthier world for every child. We hope your \u2665\ufe0f can bloom with generosity.\"", "images":
