While talking about family, Beckinsale revealed her 18-year-old daughter\u2019s crush on the late-night talk show host.\n\nRELATED: Kate Beckinsale Reportedly Files Police Report After Stalker Threat\n\nWhat\u2019s more, her daughter \u2014 Lily Sheen \u2014 was sitting front row in the live studio audience. \u201cYou know how they have crushes on Justin Bieber and things like that?\u201d Beckinsale asked Kimmel. \u201cShe\u2019s got one on you.\u201d\n\nBut things are a tad complicated in the family. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a tricky situation because my daughter\u2019s dad is dating Jimmy\u2019s ex-girlfriend \u2014 it\u2019s very twisted. It\u2019s a sort of horrible, \u2018Human Centipede\u2019-y vibe,\u201d \u201cThe Aviator\u201d star revealed.\n\nThe camera turned to the beautiful 18-year-old who, to her credit, kept her head high and shared a big smile. \u201cI think you should be pleased,\u201d Beckinsale said. \u201cShe\u2019s very attractive,\u201d she continued before warning Kimmel: \u201cShe\u2019s out of your league!

I had nothing to do with this! This is all her! This is your mother! Let\u2019s not ruin the crush thing. I want to keep that going, okay? Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I\u2019m flattered. [Now] we\u2019re both embarrassed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of mothers, Beckinsale\u2019s own mom wasn\u2019t safe from the actress\u2019s hilarious rampage either! \u201cI know Reddit is the one where sometimes you can find pictures of porn stars with your own face on it,\u201d she dished. \u201cI\u2019ve been sent a few very distressing photos of myself\u2014very busy, actually. Not just sort of in a wicker chair, naked\u2014but involved.\u201d\n\nAnd so the actress did the most reasonable thing she could. \u201cI just immediately sent it to my mother with no explanation to see what would happen,\u201d Beckinsale recalled. \u201cBut, really offensively, I get a text back going, \u2018Oh, darling! Oh, dear! Oh, no! Oh, phew! You\u2019ve got hardwood floors and that\u2019s a carpet.'\u201d\n\nTo hear Beckinsale tell the whole story, watch below.\n\nBeckinsale will reprise her role as Selene in the upcoming \u201cUnderworld 6\u201d.", "images": ["https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/162238_3320.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/162592_0054.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/corus.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/ad-choices.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/awards-banner-350x150.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cropped-etcanada-blue.png?w=32", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/global.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-454960293.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-454960293.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/162592_0054.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/newsletter/newsletter-large.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/OTWAliceandMaster02.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/cj058gk7ve-j85qdlk7px/ETC031522TBTJulietteLewisBestRoles01.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=90", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/ofy7npnbai-2nl2qwcfrt/ETC031522CelebEstateStallone.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/3l46mqci6d-epaiw19ua7/ETC0315TheLostCityPremiere.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/shutterstock_editorial_12645322bo.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/thumbnail_brick-340x150-1.jpeg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/3yzy074ydc-hdhxiluc50/A11_Ben_Affleck_JLo_Spain_and_Deep_Water.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=82", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/royals-brick-340x150-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cropped-etcanada-blue.png?w=32", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shakiel Mahjouri"], "canonical_link": "https://etcanada.com/news/245222/kate-beckinsale-royally-embarrasses-her-daughter-on-jimmy-kimmel-live/", "title": "Kate Beckinsale Royally Embarrasses Her Daughter On \u2018Jimmy Kimmel Live!\u2019", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "x4SpOp2Us67I6MlQN2uFse9KXvwgu1d8_r5F2qkIbYc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 5.9.2", "title": "Kate Beckinsale Royally Embarrasses Her Daughter On \u2018Jimmy Kimmel Live!\u2019", "author": "Shakiel Mahjouri", "description": "Never go on a late-night talk show with your mom, ever.
