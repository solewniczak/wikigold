The mother-of-one who welcomed baby boy, Bear into the world last March with boyfriend Liam Payne is due to release her fifth studio album at the end of the year with a new single due in the summer.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BSEw6PMhbx6/?taken-by=cherylofficial\n\nHer return to the recording studio was confirmed by hit record producer Naughty Boy who has been enlisted by the former X Factor judge for her comeback. Cheryl last released an LP back in 2014; The top-ten hit \u2018Only Human\u2018. Since January Chezza has been recording and writing with Naughty Boy, ex Girls Aloud bandmate Nicola Roberts, and 2017 X Factor champions Rak-Su as she looks to create a new sound.\n\nAnd while Cheryl has kept quiet on what her new music has been inspired by or what genre she is gearing towards, producer Naughty Boy whose real name is Shahid Khan has revealed to The Sun newspaper that the \u2018Fight For This Love\u2019 hitmaker\u2019s new single has been inspired by her baby boy, Bear.\n\nThe tot will turn 1 on March 22nd and it looks like his first year has been a big inspiration to his mother. Speaking to The Sun, Naughty Boy said; \u201cCheryl has got back in the studio just after having a baby and it\u2019s still very personal, but she is a real artist and a perfectionist. I can\u2019t tell you the name of her track but it has been influenced by her son Bear.\u201d\n\nHe also added that the track will feel \u201cvery special and meaningful\u201d.\n\nAre you excited for new music from Cheryl this year?
