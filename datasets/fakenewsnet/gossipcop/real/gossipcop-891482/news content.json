If you do as Ina does, chances are you are going to get a good product\u2026I got real respect for her.\u201d\n\nanthony-bourdain-1 Credit: Stephen Lovekin/REX/Shutterstock; Noam Galai/WireImage\n\nThe Parts Unknown host previously credited Garten as \u201cone of the few people on Food Network who can actually cook.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Ina Garten roasts a chicken, she roasts it correct. When Ina Garten makes mashed potatoes, those are some solid mashed potatoes,\u201d he told Atlanta magazine.\n\nHowever, his respect for the Barefoot Contessa star didn\u2019t keep Bourdain from taking a stab at Garten\u2019s beloved husband Jeffrey.\n\n\u201cIn many ways I want Ina\u2019s life. I don\u2019t want to live in her house. I don\u2019t want to spend a weekend there,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt gets weird in Ina Land . . . \u2018Oh, when Jeffrey gets home, he\u2019ll be so happy I made meatloaf.\u2019 And then he comes home and you\u2019re pretty sure he\u2019s not into meatloaf.\u201d\n\nBourdain has long been unafraid to take down big names in the entertainment industry. Most recently he spoke out against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein after he was accused of sexual harassment and assault by a number of woman, including the chef\u2019s girlfriend Asia Argento.\n\n\u201cI am proud and honored to know you,\u201d Bourdain tweeted to Argento after the actress detailed her experience with Weinstein to the New Yorker. \u201cYou just did the hardest thing in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we use the word \u2018rapist\u2019 now? #Weinstein,\u201d he later posted.\n\nWant the ultimate dish on the latest celebrity food news, plus exclusive recipes, videos and more?
