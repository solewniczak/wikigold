The actress\u2019 bold style can always be counted on as a source of intrigue and excitement at events, and the Black Panther premiere was no different. What was surprising, however, was that the film\u2019s star experimented from the other side of fashion and designed a dress for her mother.\n\nNyong\u2019o shared the look, which has all of the hallmarks of her own style. The textile-showcasing gown was created by the actress in collaboration with Los Angeles-based African retailer Kutula. \u201cMy mummy looked so pretty at the @blackpanther premiere! @kutula and I designed her dress. #humblebrag #BlackPanther,\u201d she wrote on Instagram, in the caption of a photo of Nyong\u2019o alongside her mother Dorothy, who accompanied her to the premiere.\n\nThe dress wasn\u2019t just special because Nyong\u2019o made it for her mother \u2014 it was also a nod to the origins of her character Nakia. \u201cCollaborating in the spirit of Wakanda unity,\u201d as the dress was described on Kutula\u2019s Instagram. For those who aren\u2019t yet familiar, Wakanda is the fictional African nation of the Marvel Comic. In the comic, Nyong\u2019o\u2019s character Nakia is selected to belong to the Dora Milaje, a special force that protects Wakanda and the superhero T\u2019Challa played by Chadwick Boseman.\n\n\u201cW A K A N D A F O R E V E R ! !,\u201d Nyong\u2019o wrote in the caption of another Instagram post, depicting her friends Ben Kahn and Dede Ayite. \u201c@blackpanther #SquadGoals\u201d\n\nNyong\u2019o also shared other snapshots of her own look to the premiere: a Versace gown, Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, and jewels from Beladora. \u201cPurple Reign. #BlackPanther #WelcomeToWakanda,\u201d she wrote in the caption.\n\nThe actress recently opened up about the importance of Black Panther to The Hollywood Reporter, describing it as a meditation on \u201cwhat it means to be from a place and welcome others into it. T\u2019Challa is the leader of an isolated nation that has managed to keep its autonomy and be self-determining because it has shielded itself from colonization, and how does that nation now relate with the rest of the world?\u201d Considering it already broke a pre-sales record a full month before its February 16 release, the message is clearly resonating.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/01/5a7258f29d14641834579289_GettyImages-911957022.jpg?w=414&h=276&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/01/31/5a7256ce7035da0fe71a86a8_lupita-nyongo-black-panther-premiere.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/01/31/5a7256ce7035da0fe71a86a8_lupita-nyongo-black-panther-premiere.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/lupita-nyongo-designed-her-moms-dress", "title": "Lupita Nyong\u2019o Designed Her Mom\u2019s Dress for the Black Panther Premiere", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@wmag", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/lupita-nyongo-designed-her-moms-dress", "type": "article", "title": "Lupita Nyong'o's Black Panther Premiere Date Was Her Mom", "description": "And she designed her mom's dress.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/01/31/5a7256ce7035da0fe71a86a8_lupita-nyongo-black-panther-premiere.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "description": "And she designed her mom's dress."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
