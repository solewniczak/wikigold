Tune in to Meghan and Harry \u2013 a Fairy-Tale Wedding on Saturday, May 19, starting at 6 a.m. ET/ 3 a.m. PT on PeopleTV \u2014 now available on PeopleTV.com and on your favorite streaming device.\n\nMeghan\u2019s father, Thomas Markle, was originally supposed to be present at these meetings as well. But on Thursday, Meghan confirmed that her dad would be unable to attend the wedding.\n\nThe news came after days of back-and-forth about his attendance at the wedding. On Monday, he said he would not attend in order to avoid embarrassing his daughter and the royal family after it was revealed that he staged photos with a paparazzi agency. Earlier on Tuesday, he said he had changed his mind and hoped to attend the wedding, and later backtracked his statement after he said his doctors told him he would need to have surgery that week.\n\nOn Thursday, Meghan released a statement confirming her father\u2019s absence at her nuptials.\n\n\u201cSadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u201d\n\nHarry and Meghan Countdown Clock Prince Harry and Meghan Markle | Credit: Samir Hussein/Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\nAs for who will walk Meghan down the aisle in his absence on Saturday, that duty will go to Prince Charles.\n\nAfter arriving by car with her mom, the bride-to-be will be greeted by her little bridal party members (including Prince George and Princess Charlotte!), who will lead the way down the aisle as Meghan takes her first steps to the altar by herself.\n\nShe will then be met by her future father-in-law, who will be waiting for her at the halfway mark to escort her the rest of the way to the altar. The length of the aisle is about 110 steps, and more than half of those will be taken solo by Meghan.\n\n\u201cIt was Meghan\u2019s wish and she is grateful for the Prince of Wales to be doing it,\u201d a royal source told PEOPLE.\n\nprince-charles Meghan Markle and Prince Charles | Credit: Eddie Mulholland/WPA Pool/Getty; Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Meghan Markle Asks Prince Charles to Walk Her Down Aisle in Absence of Her Dad: \u2018It Was Her Wish\u2019\n\nMeghan and Harry arrived at Windsor Castle on Friday for their final wedding rehearsal.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fprince-charles1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=750&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fqueen-elizabeth1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F248515971_423792849226570_1672372709981615183_n.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F11%2Fharry-meghan-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fqueen-elizabeth1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=750&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fqueen-elizabeth1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn", "May"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/royals/tea-time-meghan-markles-mom-meets-the-queen-for-the-first-time-ahead-of-royal-wedding/", "title": "Tea Time!
