I didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t tacitly approve of rape. I didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t like young women being assaulted. I didn\u2019t know this was happening.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where Harvey lives, nor has he ever been to my home.\n\nI have never in my life been invited to his hotel room.\n\nI have been to his office once, for a meeting with Wes Craven for \u201cMusic of the Heart\u201d in 1998.\n\nHW distributed movies I made with other people.\n\nHW was not a filmmaker; he was often a producer, primarily a marketer of films made by other people- some of them great, some not great. But not every actor, actress, and director who made films that HW distributed knew he abused women, or that he raped Rose in the 90s, other women before and others after, until they told us. We did not know that women\u2019s silence was purchased by him and his enablers.\n\nHW needed us not to know this, because our association with him bought him credibility, an ability to lure young, aspiring women into circumstances where they would be hurt.\n\nHe needed me much more than I needed him and he made sure I didn\u2019t know. Apparently he hired ex Mossad operators to protect this information from becoming public. Rose and the scores of other victims of these powerful, moneyed, ruthless men face an adversary for whom Winning, at any and all costs, is the only acceptable outcome. That\u2019s why a legal defense fund for victims is currently being assembled to which hundreds of good hearted people in our business will contribute, to bring down the bastards, and help victims fight this scourge within.\n\nRose assumed and broadcast something untrue about me, and I wanted to let her know the truth. Through friends who know her, I got my home phone number to her the minute I read the headlines. I sat by that phone all day yesterday and this morning, hoping to express both my deep respect for her and others\u2019 bravery in exposing the monsters among us, and my sympathy for the untold, ongoing pain she suffers. No one can bring back what entitled bosses like Bill O\u2019Reilly, Roger Ailes, and HW took from the women who endured attacks on their bodies and their ability to make a living.. And I hoped that she would give me a hearing. She did not, but I hope she reads this.\n\nI am truly sorry she sees me as an adversary, because we are both, together with all the women in our business, standing in defiance of the same implacable foe: a status quo that wants so badly to return to the bad old days, the old ways where women were used, abused and refused entry into the decision-making, top levels of the industry. That\u2019s where the cover-ups convene. Those rooms must be disinfected, and integrated, before anything even begins to change.\u201d", "images":
