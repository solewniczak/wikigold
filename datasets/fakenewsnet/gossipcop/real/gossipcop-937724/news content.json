What a terrible photo of you.\u2019 I look over. \u2018Really. I kind of like that photo.

Some of the comments on the post instead said I was being a bully and should have taken the \u201chigh road\u201d (some also doubled down on the body shaming. Thumbs up guys!)\u201d\n\nAdams said after considering the criticism from fans, he decided to take down the post.\n\n\u201cI thought it over and agreed and took it down, not because I felt the woman was right or fair or undeserving of being called out but because any sense of being a bully or lashing out felt wrong,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019m no bully. What that woman said to us was offensive and unnecessary but I should have told her she was rude and out of line and left it at that. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t. I was too shocked and annoyed and Canadian \u2013 so I avoided the confrontation. Again, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nSophia Bush commented on the post, praising Adams for the recognizing his mistake.\n\n\u201cWell done friend,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPeople forget that you\u2019re human.
