She explained, \u201cMusic is my first love and I think it was the universe saying: \u2018Okay, you speak all of this language about self-love and authenticity, but we are going to put you through another test and take away any kind of validating \u2018blankie.\u2019 Then we\u2019ll see how much you do truly love yourself.'\u201d\n\nShe continued on to say, \u201cThat brokenness, plus me opening up to a greater, higher power and reconnecting with divinity, gave me a wholeness I never had. It gave me a new foundation. It\u2019s not just a material foundation: it\u2019s a soul foundation.\u201d\n\nThis spiritual awakening comes as no surprise to fans of the \u201cI Kissed A Girl\u201d singer. In February, the star told Glamour, \u201cThis last year has been about killing my ego, which has been really necessary for my career. But for my personal life, it doesn\u2019t work that way. If I want to have that true balance, I have to step into being Katheryn Hudson.\u201d\n\nThat back-to-basics mentality has helped the 33-year-old to value the relationships and people around her, like rumored boyfriend Orlando Bloom.\n\nIn April, the songstress and her actor boyfriend were able to meet the Pope as part of Unite to Cure conference in Vatican City. It was at the gathering that the pop star sung her praises about meditational therapy, which she claims \u201chelped a lot with my anxiety.\u201d\n\nWe are glad to hear Katy is back to feeling like the \u201cFirework\u201d she is.", "images": ["https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1580411-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/nf-logo-3.png", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1647329555_GettyImages-1238527017-958ca1-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/9ZdeQWD7jheUbnwGR96stk-1200-80-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/220314223452-biden-03142022-super-tease-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WireAP_0612d4582335445f85e2eccd38c4fb16_16x9_992-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/katy-perry-suffered-from-situational-depression-due-to-widely-panned-witness-album.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1580661-250x250.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1647322939_Love-Is-Blinds-Shake-Shares-Newlyweds-Clip-Slams-Sad-Nick-Lachey-001-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/55361027-10613183-iOSAT_iodine_pills_pictured_A_box_of_IOSAT_130_mg_pills_was_sell-m-17_1647312146165-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1580506-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/220314-tate-reeves-ac-1010p-73825a-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1580672-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/220309010654-03-hk-covid-wave-2022-inequality-super-tease-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/florida-kill-list-523-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1580421-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1580673-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1580382-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-ss-ftr1-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Rob-Lowe-Wife-Sheryl-Berkoff-ss-ftr-1-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/themes/customizr/assets/front/img/thumb-standard-empty.png", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/09MIUMIU-facebookJumbo-250x250.jpg", "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/55279425-10613461-image-a-51_1647315424663-250x250.jpg"], "top_img": "https://newsflash.one/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/katy-perry-suffered-from-situational-depression-due-to-widely-panned-witness-album.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://newsflash.one/2018/07/18/katy-perry-suffered-from-situational-depression-due-to-widely-panned-witness-album/", "title": "Katy Perry Suffered From \u201cSituational Depression\u201d Due to Widely Panned Witness Album", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Katy Perry Suffered From \"Situational Depression'' Due to Widely Panned Witness Album - News Flash", "description": "Emma Summerton/Vogue Australia Katy Perry is bouncing back after a bout of \u201csituational depression.\u201d The singer delved into the emotional details of her last year when she sat down with Vogue Australia for their August issue.
