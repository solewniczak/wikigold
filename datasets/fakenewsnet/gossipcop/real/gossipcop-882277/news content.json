Times often \u2014 and always had something memorable to say\n\n(Liz O. Baylen / Los Angeles Times)\n\nUnderstanding Playboy-in-Chief Hugh Hefner\u2019s revered \u2014 and reviled \u2014 lifestyle was often just a question or two away.\n\nThe iconoclastic publishing mogul, who died Wednesday at 91, was an open book when it came to his views on swinging ways and sexuality, particularly how his puritanical upbringing shaped his career and gave rise to the revolutionary Playboy empire.\n\nOver the years, the perennially pajama-clad Hef was interviewed often by the Los Angeles Times. Here\u2019s a sampling of some of his memorable quotes.\n\nOn sexuality\u2019s problematic origins in America:\n\n\u201cOur society is fragmented,\u201d he asserted in 1994. \u201cMessages regarding human sexuality have always been mixed in America. We are a schizophrenic nation. We were founded initially by Puritans, who escaped repression only to establish their own. Then the founding fathers gave us the Constitution to separate church and state. But the one thing that got left out of all those laws was human sexuality.\u201d\n\nOn the life he made for himself:\n\n\u201cMuch of my life has been like an adolescent dream of an adult life,\u201d he told The Times in 1992. \u201cIf you were still a boy, in almost a Peter Pan kind of way, and could have just the perfect life that you wanted to have, that\u2019s the life I invented for myself.\u201d\n\nOBITUARY: Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, who shook up American morality with an ideal of swinging singlehood, dies at 91\n\nOn why he was so happy:\n\n\u201cYou will find in my bedroom images from long ago, little photographs and things from when I was a kid. I\u2019m a very happy guy, and part of that has to do with my connection to my childhood,\u201d he said in 2009.\n\nOn how he became \u201cHef\u201d:\n\n\u201cThrough a lifetime, you reinvent who you are,\u201d he explained in 2009. \u201cI actually reinvented myself the first time when I was 16, when a girl rejected me. I started referring to myself as Hef, started changing my wardrobe \u2014 the same thing I did in 1959-1960 with the magazine, when I came out from behind the desk and started living the life and got the first Playboy mansion, started to drive a Mercedes 300SL.\u201d\n\nOn how the 1942 film \u201cCasablanca\u201d led to the Playboy Club:\n\n\u201cI think I opened the first Playboy Club because of \u2018Casablanca.\u2019 I wanted to have a place where people came to hang out as they did at Rick\u2019s,\u201d he said in 2010. \u201cIt has everything \u2014 not only Bogie\u2019s charismatic character, but lost love, redemption, patriotism, humor \u2014 it had a great musical score.\u201d\n\nOn traditional attitudes toward marriage and sex:\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t commit,\u201d he told The Times in 1994, \u201cyou don\u2019t get hurt. I was always unwilling to commit to marriage because I was afraid to lose the romance.\u201d\n\nOn the Playboy brand\u2019s global status:\n\n\u201cIt has been said that the two most famous trademarks in the world are Coca-Cola and the Playboy bunny rabbit,\u201d he said in 1994. \u201cThere is certainly no one else in our area that represents the American dream in this particular kind of way. That rabbit means economic freedom, personal freedom and political freedom. That potential is unlimited.\u201d\n\nOn the Playboy Jazz Festival:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never found anything that I\u2019ve cared more about than the music from my youth. I loved the Beatles, sure, but I never became \u2014 except for dancing purposes \u2014 a hard rocker. To me, there is something incredibly celebratory, and so wonderful about really good big-band swing and Dixieland,\u201d he said in 2002.\n\n\u201cWhen I started, I just wanted to put out a men\u2019s magazine. But by the end of the \u201850s, it was so successful that I seized it as a vehicle for changing the direction of my life,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that crucial change in my life was also associated with jazz, because it all began within a space of about six months after the first Playboy Jazz Festival in August of 1959.\u201d\n\nHugh Hefner, founder of the Playboy empire, relaxes during a visit to England in 1966. (John Downing / Getty Images)\n\nOn his personal legacy:\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons that I have such tremendous satisfaction at this point in my life is because I know I\u2019ve made a difference,\u201d he said in 1994. \u201cI\u2019ve made a difference in a way that really matters to me.\u201d\n\nOn publishing\u2019s shift to digital:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t sit around thinking about, \u2018Gee, what happened to the new generation and they don\u2019t read enough and why is the internet replacing books?\u2019\u201d he said in 2009.\n\nOn his fame and sex appeal:\n\n\u201cI think that just as [Henry] Kissinger said, power is the ultimate aphrodisiac. Celebrity is the ultimate aphrodisiac in today\u2019s world. And I\u2019m lucky enough to have fallen into a unique kind of celebrity,\u201d he said in 2009. \u201cSo against all logic, nothing else matters \u2014 age doesn\u2019t matter. When [my last long-term] relationship ended, last year, they were climbing over the gate. ... young women. Endless numbers of young women.\u201d\n\nALSO\n\nHugh Hefner\u2019s life pushing boundaries started with comics\n\nHugh Hefner\u2019s Playboy Mansion was hedonistic headquarters for his brand\n\n\u2018Your legacy lives on\u2019: Hugh Hefner is remembered as an innovator, friend and supporter of civil rights", "images": ["https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7046e4f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F57d858144a2a88575fa2b03080bb%2Flatlogo-ss.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7046e4f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F57d858144a2a88575fa2b03080bb%2Flatlogo-ss.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-september-2017-htmlstory.html", "title": "Today in Entertainment: Olivia de Havilland scores court victory; \u2018Sex and the City 3\u2019 gets scrapped", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Today in Entertainment: Olivia de Havilland scores court victory; 'Sex and the City 3' gets scrapped", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-september-2017-htmlstory.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7046e4f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F57d858144a2a88575fa2b03080bb%2Flatlogo-ss.jpg", "url": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7046e4f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F57d858144a2a88575fa2b03080bb%2Flatlogo-ss.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg", "alt": "LA Times logo"}, "description": "Here's what's new and interesting in entertainment and the arts:Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan officially join 'American Idol'Olivia de Havilland scores court victory; trial will begin Nov. 27'Sex and the City 3'?
