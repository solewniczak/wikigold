He begged to get out and opened the door but she continued to pull away while he was getting out and it tore up his entire arm. It\u2019s a mess from road rash and from being dragged along the street as he was caught in the belt.\u201d\n\nThe source also confirmed that a mutual friend stepped in to take care of the exes\u2019 infant daughter, noting that \u201ceverybody is so fearful for this baby.\u201d\n\nAccording to the source, Ortiz-Magro had been \u201ctrying his best\u201d to make things work with Harley for the sake of their daughter.\n\n\u201cIf the kid wasn\u2019t involved, it would be over,\u201d said the source. \u201cHe\u2019s constantly trying to make it work for the sake of his daughter. But we\u2019re hopeful this is the final straw and he doesn\u2019t put himself and his daughter back in danger.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Ortiz-Magro flew from Las Vegas to New Jersey with his daughter to resume filming season 2 of Jersey Shore Family Vacation.\n\nronnie-magro-1 Credit: Ronnie Ortiz-Magro/Instagram\n\nronnie-magro-2 Credit: Ronnie Ortiz-Magro/Instagram\n\nThe proud dad documented the
