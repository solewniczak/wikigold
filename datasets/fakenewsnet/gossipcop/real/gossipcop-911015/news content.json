But anyone on the receiving end of Kardashian West\u2019s fragrance largesse might want to check their present against her color-coded gift list first, because they might be in some petty \u2013 sorry, we mean pretty \u2013 rarefied company among anyone who\u2019s ever had beef with the star.\n\nKardashian West\u2019s new Kimoji Hearts KKW Fragrances just dropped on KKWFragrance.com today and to celebrate, the star mailed out boxes filled with a large, hollow chocolate heart made by Chef Chris Ford (with the fragrance stashed inside) to special people in her life. Each recipient gets box filled with one of the three new scents \u2014 BFF, Bae and Ride or Die \u2014 and Kardashian West took special care to decide who gets which.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cAlright guys. I am writing the list for my press boxes. I\u2019m going to send them to way more than this, but I decided this Valentine\u2019s Day, everyone deserves a Valentine, so I\u2019m going to send them to my lovers, to my haters, to everyone that I think of because it is Valentine\u2019s Day after all,\u201d the reality star said on Instagram Story as she showed colored Post-It notes with names written on them identifying who gets which fragrance.\n\nUnknown\n\nEach fragrance comes in a different color packaging \u2013 Bae in blue, Ride or Die in purple and BFF in pink \u2013 so the assumption is that each color corresponds with the chocolate heart each named celebrity will be receiving via hand-delivery. A scan of the \u201cBae\u201d recipients might indicate that Kardashian West has designated a certain type of person to receive that fragrance \u2013 namely, a long list of people she\u2019s had beef with in the past.\n\nLooking for more style content?
