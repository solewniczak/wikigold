Cattrall has claimed that she has refused to board a third film since 2016, but the source tells PEOPLE she \u201cwas negotiating as recently as this summer\u201d to join the movie. (Studio Warner Bros. has not commented.)\n\nA second source also told PEOPLE that the cast \u201chave had their issues over the years.\u201d\n\nSex and The City - 1998-2004 Credit: Craig Blankenhorn/Hbo/Darren Star Prods./Kobal/REX/Shutterstock\n\nDuring a sitdown with Piers Morgan for ITV\u2018s series Life Stories, Cattrall, 61, said that she had refused to board the movie multiple times throughout the past year. She also bashed reports by DailyMailTV that claimed the third movie was shelved because of Cattrall\u2019s \u201coutrageous demands\u201d to the studio to produce other movies she had in development.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite extraordinary to get any kind of negative press about something that I\u2019ve been saying for almost a year of \u2018no\u2019 that I\u2019m demanding or a diva,\u201d Cattrall said, according to the Daily Mail. \u201cThe answer was always no and a respectful, firm, no.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never asked for any money, I never asked for any projects,\u201d she continued. \u201cTo be thought of as some kind of diva is absolutely ridiculous.\u201d\n\nCattrall then called out Parker \u2014 who would have been a producer on the film: \u201cAnd this is really where I take to task the people from Sex and the City and specifically Sarah Jessica Parker in that I think she could have been nicer.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Sarah Jessica Parker Admits She Begged to Get out of \u2018Sex and the City\u2019 \u2013 Before Falling for Carrie\n\nCattrall and Parker\u2019s reps have not responded to a request for comment.\n\nParker told Extra that Sex and the City 3 had a \u201cbeautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just disappointing that we don\u2019t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie,\u201d she said.\n\nRumors that Samantha, Carrie, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) were reuniting for a new film \u2014 which would follow 2008\u2019s Sex and the City and 2010\u2019s Sex and the City 2 \u2014had long swirled before Parker\u2019s announcement that the movie was off.\n\nParker wasn\u2019t the only one feeling regret for Sex and the City\u2019s end. Garson also previously tweeted that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d for the crew members who counted on working on the third installment.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1421&h=711&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fwillie-garson-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fwillie-garson-1-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1421&h=711&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fwillie-garson-1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jodi Guglielmi", "October"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/sex-and-the-citys-willie-garson-throws-major-shade-at-kim-cattrall-as-he-wades-into-movie-controversy-because-im-toxic/", "title": "Sex and the City's Willie Garson Throws Major Shade at Kim Cattrall", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Kim Cattrall,Sarah Jessica Parker,Sex and the City,Sex and the City 2", "news_keywords": "Kim Cattrall,Sarah Jessica Parker,Sex and the City,Sex and the City 2", "description": "Sex and the City's Willie Garson Throws Major Shade at Kim Cattrall as He Wades Into Movie Controversy: 'Because I'm Toxic'", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Sex and the City's Willie Garson Throws Major Shade at Kim Cattrall as He Wades Into Movie Controversy: 'Because I'm Toxic'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/sex-and-the-citys-willie-garson-throws-major-shade-at-kim-cattrall-as-he-wades-into-movie-controversy-because-im-toxic/", "description": "Sex and the City's Willie Garson Throws Major Shade at Kim Cattrall as He Wades Into Movie Controversy: 'Because I'm Toxic'", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1421&h=711&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fwillie-garson-1-2000.jpg", "width": 1421, "height": 711}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/movies/sex-and-the-citys-willie-garson-throws-major-shade-at-kim-cattrall-as-he-wades-into-movie-controversy-because-im-toxic/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fwillie-garson-1-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/movies/sex-and-the-citys-willie-garson-throws-major-shade-at-kim-cattrall-as-he-wades-into-movie-controversy-because-im-toxic/", "title": "Sex and the City's Willie Garson Throws Major Shade at Kim Cattrall as He Wades Into Movie Controversy: 'Because I'm Toxic'", "description": "Sex and the City's Willie Garson Throws Major Shade at Kim Cattrall as He Wades Into Movie Controversy: 'Because I'm Toxic'", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1421&h=711&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fwillie-garson-1-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/movies/sex-and-the-citys-willie-garson-throws-major-shade-at-kim-cattrall-as-he-wades-into-movie-controversy-because-im-toxic/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
