She has also released two books, Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny in 2015 and The Vegas Diaries: Romance, Rolling the Dice, and the Road to Reinvention in 2016.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nHolly Madison was born in Astoria, Oregon.[2] At age two, she moved with her family to Craig, Alaska, on Prince of Wales Island.[4] When she was in middle school, her family returned to St. Helens, Oregon. She later attended Portland State University for two years, majoring in theater and psychology.[4] Afterward, Madison moved to Los Angeles and attended Loyola Marymount University.[2]\n\nTo afford her college tuition, Madison competed to become a Hawaiian Tropic model and worked as a waitress at Hooters.[5] Her appearance at these venues led to invitations to the Playboy Mansion and at the age of 21, after more than a year of such visits, Madison asked permission from Hugh Hefner and was eventually allowed to move in at the mansion.[6]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nRelationship with Hugh Hefner and Playboy [ edit ]\n\nFacing credit card debt and potential homelessness, in August 2001, Madison moved into the Playboy Mansion and officially became one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends. Hefner controlled her finances, enforced a strict schedule and curfew, and denied her opportunities to earn income outside the mansion.[7] In February 2002, after all but two of his girlfriends left, Madison became his \"#1 Girl\".[2] During her time with Hefner, Madison stated that she wanted to marry him and have his children. However, in an interview at the Playmate of the Year luncheon in May 2008, Hefner said, \"I love Holly very much and I think we're going to be together the rest of my life, but marriage isn't part of my puzzle. It's not a personal thing; I just haven't had much luck with marriages.\"[8] Reflecting on her time at the mansion, Madison has said her feelings for Hefner were attributable to Stockholm syndrome.[7]\n\nOn October 7, 2008, Madison announced that her relationship with Hefner had ended, but that she, Bridget Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson were \"still filming stuff together\".[9] Hefner confirmed the breakup, saying, \"If Holly says it's over, I guess it's over\".[10]\n\n2003\u20132009: The Girls Next Door [ edit ]\n\nThe Girls Next Door was an E! Network show following life of Madison and others at the Playboy Mansion.

The women were featured again on the covers of the September 2006, March 2008, and February 2009 issues. During seasons three and four, Madison was shown working at the Playboy studios as an intern and later a junior photo editor. She also helped design and put together The Girls Next Door calendars.

It's not a vanity credit. I'm super excited to learn from the best and take on new responsibilities.\"[21] The show premiered on December 6, 2009, and ran for two seasons.[22]\n\nPublications [ edit ]\n\nIn 2015, Madison released her memoir Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny.[23] The book details her life in the Playboy Mansion and the beginning of her recovery afterward.[24]\n\nIn May 2016, Madison released her second memoir, The Vegas Diaries: Romance, Rolling the Dice and the Road to Reinvention,[25] which also debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list.[26] The book chronicles her journey toward reinvention and self-acceptance in glamorous Las Vegas.[27]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nIn 2009, Madison said, \"I'm never dating anybody again. I don't need a man. I'm really happy with myself and being with my friends... I'm focused on forwarding my career. I'm working on producing my own shows.
