From the tweed of the Hebrides to Nottingham lace, and of course Carnaby Street, our fashion industry has been renowned for outstanding craftsmanship for many years, and continues to produce world-class textiles and cutting edge, practical designs.\n\n\u201cAs a tribute to the industry, and as my legacy to all those who have contributed to British fashion, I would like to present this award for new, young talent. I would like to thank the British Fashion Council for selecting the first winner \u2013 Richard Quinn.\u201d\n\nThe Queen\u2019s visit to the London Fashion Week headquarters had been kept secret and her low-key arrival caused a ripple of astonishment among attendees.\n\nShe began by viewing a millinery exhibition curated by the legendary Stephen Jones.

I took my hat off and barely knew what to say. But she was just lovely.\u201d\n\nRoyal visit to London Fashion Week Queen Elizabeth | Credit: Yui Mok/PA Wire/AP\n\nPhilippine-born Santos, a former ballet dancer continued: \u201cShe was just lovely and so softly spoken. She was interested in my crown and what inspired me. I also told her about my former career as a dancer and she joked, \u2018That must have been quite a leap,\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I was the only Queen here, but I have been dethroned today! I couldn\u2019t have been happier about it,\u201d he added.", "images":
