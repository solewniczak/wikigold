She will always have the right to go back into court if further incidents of domestic abuse occur.\u201d\n\nStill, Bloom says \u201cthis agreement does not resolve all disputes between Chyna and Rob.\u201d\n\nKardashian and Chyna\u2019s roller coaster relationship began in January 2016, when the two went public with their romance. The pairing initially raised eyebrows due to Chyna\u2019s complicated history with the Kardashian-Jenner family: She shares a son with Kardashian\u2019s sister Kylie Jenner\u2018s former boyfriend Tyga and is best friends with Amber Rose, an ex of Kanye West, who is now married to Kim Kardashian West.\n\nBlac Chyna & Rob Kardashian Visit Onyx Nightclub Credit: Prince Williams/WireImage\n\nThe two feuded on social media throughout their relationship, but the tension reached its peak on July 5, when Kardashian repeatedly shared graphic and expletive-ridden content about his ex \u2014 including three naked photos \u2014 while accusing her of drug use, alcohol abuse and infidelity.\n\nFROM PEN: Blac Chyna Recalls the Shocking Moment Rob Kardashian Uploaded Her Most Intimate Photos

quiet and not get into any more trouble,\u201d said the source, adding that Kardashian \u2014 who has long struggled with his weight and depression \u2014 \u201cisn\u2019t healthy, and isn\u2019t making huge efforts to get healthier, but he does really care about Dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe loves spending time with her,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe always misses Dream when she is with Chyna.\u201d\n\nIn an exclusive sit-down with PEOPLE in July, Chyna insisted she\u2019s committed to co-parenting her daughter with her ex.", "images":
