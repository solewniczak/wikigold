But according to \u201cWinter Games\u201d cast member Michael Garofola, there was a lot of plot that got left on the cutting room floor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael stopped by the \u201cHere To Make Friends\u201d podcast to share the inside scoop on house dynamics, love interests we didn\u2019t see, and more. Here\u2019s what we learned:\n\n1. The very international cast talked a lot about politics in the house.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely a pervasive topic in the house, even though it\u2019s obviously not being shown,\u201d said Michael. \u201cWhen this show was filming, the big story is all the Roy Moore stuff is going on. That was also when Trump tweeted basically admitting to obstructing justice... So these things are all being discussed and we were like, \u2018Ah, they\u2019re gonna cut all this out.\u2019... [But] it\u2019s relevant, it\u2019s topical. We were, at one point, sitting around the island in the kitchen and there was a big talk with everyone, and basically they denoted me to be the speaker on behalf of apologizing for the United States and explaining what was going on. I jokingly tweeted this, but feel like my role there was to improve United States diplomatic relations with our foreign allies.\u201d\n\n2. The \u201cBachelor\u201d anthem was written by the high-school girl who sang it!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat was a local high school student who wrote the song herself. They did not give it to her,\u201d said Michael. \u201cChris Harrison introduced her [at the opening ceremonies] ... I think her mission was to write something funny and cheesy.\u201d\n\nBen Higgins and Luke Pell on \"The Bachelor Winter Games.\" ABC\n\n3. Some of the contestants weren\u2019t initially told the competition would include real Olympic sports.\n\n\u201cWhen I was asked to do this show, I was like, \u2018Look, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve gone skiing, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve gone ice skating,\u2019\u201d said Michael. \u201cThey said, \u2018Oh, Michael G., don\u2019t worry. We don\u2019t wanna get sued by the Olympics! We\u2019re not gonna do real winter sports. We can\u2019t do that. We\u2019re gonna do like, snowball fights and who can build a snowman fastest.\u2019\u201d\n\nWelp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Michael had some potential love interests that never went anywhere, so they got cut.\n\nOn Jenny, from Finland: \u201cI was sort of talking to Jenny. Nothing really developed there. She spoke English very well but she was very insecure and self-conscious about her ability to speak English ... She had some difficulty and I think that ultimately for me, if I\u2019m gonna date someone long-distance from Helsinki I need that to be like, \u2018Wow, I\u2019ve never found this kind of feeling before.\u2019 Jenny is lovely but I think we were trying and then it just didn\u2019t happen. There was no making out.\u201d\n\nOn Lesley, from the USA: \u201dI love Lesley and Dean together. I love both of them individually as well. But look, I\u2019ve known Lesley for a while \u2015 she was on the [\u201cBachelor\u201d] season before mine [of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d].... She and I had a couple really great conversations, and then she hit it off with Dean. There was an undeniable chemistry there.\u201d\n\nFor more behind-the-scenes insight about \u201cThe Bachelor Winter Games,\u201d check out the full episode:", "images":
