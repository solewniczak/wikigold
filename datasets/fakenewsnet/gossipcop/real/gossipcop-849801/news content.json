Clendenin / Los Angeles Times) Actress Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz has long been known as a strong voice when it comes to issues of feminism, whether it\u2019s over-sexualization of female characters or equal pay for women. Now she\u2019s speaking out against the marketing campaign behind one of her own projects. Moretz went on social media Wednesday to address criticism that marketing for the animated film \u201cRed Shoes and the 7 Dwarfs\u201d \u2014 an updated tweak on the Snow White story, with Moretz as the voice of the classic fairy-tale character \u2014 engages in body-shaming. \u201cI have now fully reviewed the [marketing] for Red Shoes, I am just as appalled and angry as everyone else, this wasn\u2019t approved by me or my team,\u201d the actress wrote. According to the website of the South Korean animation studio behind the film, its story centers on \u201ca Princess who doesn\u2019t fit into the celebrity world of Princesses \u2014 or their dress size.\u201d When she puts on a pair of magical red shoes, she instantly becomes skinnier. The film\u2019s synopsis promises an empowering message in which Snow White \u201clearns not only to accept herself, but to celebrate who she is, inside and out.\u201d But the film\u2019s trailer and other marketing materials have been blasted as fat-shaming. Plus-size model Tess Holliday took to Twitter to criticize a billboard for the film that appeared at the Cannes Film Festival, where \u201cRed Shoes\u201d was seeking distribution, that suggested that the less svelte Snow White was \u201cno longer beautiful.\u201d How did this get approved by an entire marketing team? Why is it okay to tell young kids being fat = ugly? \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude0f@ChloeGMoretz pic.twitter.com/PVhgwluGTM \u2014 Tess Holliday \ud83e\udd40 (@Tess_Holliday) May 30, 2017 Hearing the complaints about the film\u2019s tone-deaf marketing, Moretz agreed \u2013 and told her more than 3 million followers so in a pair of tweets.

The Oscar-winning musician, who is an executive producer and played abolitionist Frederick Douglass on the Underground Railroad-centered show, rallied fans to give it a second life when cable broadcaster WGN America announced Tuesday it would be canceling the series after two seasons. The network has been scaling down its investment in original programming as part of a deal that its parent company, Tribune Media, made with conservative-leaning Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. Sinclair\u2019s purchase of Tribune gives it control of more than 200 local TV stations and WGN America. The shift was not lost on Legend, who fired off a series of tweets to promote the content brought forth by \u201cUnderground\u201d and its creators, Misha Green and Joe Pokaski. \u201cWGN America has been bought and is going a different direction strategically. We will find a new home for Underground!\u201d he tweeted, adding, \u201cContent wins. We\u2019re not reliant on a particular network to make great content. We\u2019re so proud of our show and the audience that supported!\u201d Legend, who has made no secret about his liberal politics, cautioned fans to \u201cbe wary of Sinclair\u201d and claimed that \u201cthey\u2019re trying to make local stations mini Fox Newses\u201d that lean even further to the right. He completed his plea by asking followers to \u201cfeel free to drop some hints to the network/streaming services you want to pick up #Underground. Show them who will be watching!\u201d View Instagram post \u201cDespite \u2018Underground\u2019 being a terrific and important series, it no longer fits with our new direction and we have reached the difficult decision not to renew it for a third season,\u201d Peter Kern, president and CEO of Tribune Media, said in a statement. \u201cIt is our hope that this remarkable show finds another home and continues its stories of courage, determination and freedom.\u201d Sony Pictures Television, the studio that produces \u201cUnderground,\u201d is said to be trying to find it a new home.

On Wednesday, the country officially banned the superhero film just hours before it was set to arrive in theaters. The ban followed an effort by a group called Campaign to Boycott Supporters of Israel, which urged the Lebanese government\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Trade to block the film because its star, Gal Gadot, is Israeli. News of the ban, which had been the subject of speculation since Monday, was announced on social media by Lebanon\u2019s Grand Cinemas and Campaign to Boycott Supporters of Israel. Lebanon has had a contentious relationship with the state of Israel for decades and has an official law on the books that encourages boycotts of products from its neighbor to the south. Israeli citizens and anyone whose passport shows they\u2019ve traveled to Israel are prohibited from entering Lebanon. Earlier films featuring Gadot, including \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u201d and \u201cFurious 7,\u201d have successfully screened in theaters in Lebanon, however. \u201cBatman v Superman,\u201d which introduced Gadot\u2019s Wonder Woman, was the third biggest hit at the box office in Lebanon last year. And, as has been pointed out, \u201cWonder Woman\u201d was, in fact, made by three companies based in America and two based in China, so calling it an Israeli product is debatable. But, on its Facebook page, the Campaign to Boycott Supporters of Israel complained that Gadot had served two years in the Israeli Defense Forces (national military service is mandatory for Israeli citizens over 18) and \u201cboasted about the army training her for Hollywood.\u201d \u201cWonder Woman\u201d lands in American theaters on Friday and, fueled by overwhelmingly positive reviews, is expected to perform strongly.

There were, however, some late-night-related tweets reacting to Twitter addict @realdonaldtrump\u2019s since-deleted mistyping of what is assumed to be the word \u201ccovering\u201d or \u201ccoverage.\u201d \u201cWhat makes me saddest,\u201d wrote Jimmy Kimmel, \u201cis that I know I\u2019ll never write anything funnier than #covfefe.\u201d The account for CBS\u2019 \u201cLate Late Show\u201d poked some fun at Trump\u2019s gaffe, too. who do you want to see on the next covfefe karaoke \u2014 The Late Late Show with James Corden (@latelateshow) May 31, 2017 Meanwhile, Trevor Noah and Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d were back after a week off, above, catching up with President Trump\u2019s whole first trip abroad. \u201cInternational Hand Stuff\u201d was the name of the segment, which framed the excursion in terms of the president\u2019s mitts. There were references to Trump touching the \u201cglowing white orb\u201d and Jerusalem\u2019s Western Wall (\u201cthey build one wall 2,000 years ago,\u201d Noah said in his Trump voice, \u201czero Mexicans in their whole country\u201d); the question of whether First Lady Melania Trump swatted away her husband\u2019s hand on the tarmac in Tel Aviv (\u201cleave it to Fox News not to recognize what rejection from a woman looks like\u201d); and Trump\u2019s power handshake from new French President Emmanuel Macron (\u201cthe first time that President Trump was on the receiving end of an unwelcome hand grab\u201d). The last manual metaphor was given to the German chancellor, who, after her visit with the American president, said, \u201cWe Europeans must take our fate into our own hands.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d said Noah, \u201cclearly Angela Merkel got one look at Trump and was like, \u2018All right, our fate is in our own hands, because his clearly ruin everything they touch.\u2019\u201d Jimmy Kimmel also looked at Trump\u2019s trip abroad, which he described, with probable irony, as \u201cspreading joy and optimism all over the world.\u201d Titled \u201cDrunk Donald Trump: Sicily,\u201d the segment replayed a portion of Trump\u2019s speech at half-speed. The effect is uncanny. Later, sitting outside on some steps -- urine-stained steps, apparently -- Kimmel asked a series of kids, who really do say the darnedest things, about the state of the union. If we measure a late-night host solely by an ability to engage with children in a way that\u2019s friendly, direct, deadpan and mostly honest, Kimmel is in a league with David Letterman, nearly.

But few are forgiving her By Nardine Saad (Lawrence K. Ho / Los Angeles Times) First Lady Melania Trump is the latest detractor of Kathy Griffin\u2019s bloody depiction of the president\u2019s decapitation. \u201cAs a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,\u201d FLOTUS said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cWhen you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.\u201d Griffin\u2019s photographs and video by photographer Tyler Shields showed the comic straight-faced, holding up a blood-splattered severed head that appeared to be Trump\u2019s. The president denounced Griffin\u2019s stunt, saying that she \u201cshould be ashamed of herself\u201d and that the piece greatly disturbed his 11-year-old son, Barron. Griffin\u2019s apology wasn\u2019t accepted by some on Twitter either, which spewed a variety of reactions, including several right-wing jabs that Griffin had been radicalized by Islamic State, the terror group that frequently beheads its victims. Several also sympathized with the president\u2019s family, citing TMZ\u2019s story about Barron believing that something horrible had happened to his father when he saw the images on the news. CNN subsequently fired Griffin from her co-hosting duties for its New Year\u2019s Eve broadcast, and she has also been dropped as a spokesperson for Squatty Potty. Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was delighted by the bathroom footstool maker\u2019s response but criticized CNN for not immediately doing the same. \u201cSo Squatty Potty pulls the plug on Kathy Griffin, but CNN still \u2018evaluating\u2019 and weighing their options,\u201d the president\u2019s eldest son tweeted. \u201cInsane what\u2019s going on there!!!\u201d He then added, \u201cApologies for my last tweet. I didn\u2019t mean to group Squatty Potty with CNN. Obviously one of them has moral/ethical standards.\u201d Griffin\u2019s CNN compatriot, Anderson Cooper, who co-hosts the giggle-filled New Year\u2019s Eve show for the cable news channel, did not come to his pal\u2019s defense. \u201cFor the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate,\u201d Cooper tweeted.

Kathy Griffin did the right thing by apologizing. That sort of behavior, that sort of message, isn't acceptable in any setting. \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) May 31, 2017 \u201cI think she did the right thing asking for forgiveness and acknowledging that this was a horrible mistake, so I think she can,\u201d Minnesota Democrat and former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer Sen. Al Franken told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cKathy\u2019s a friend and she\u2019s a terrific comedian, but this had no business being in our public discourse...,\u201d Franken said. \u201cAnd I talked to her. She has apologized \u2014 a real, fulsome apology. She\u2019s actually begged for forgiveness, and I believe in forgiveness.\u201d Still, there was more snark to be had.

That\u2019s in line with what her husband said in an open letter written shortly after her death on April 22 at age 56. Tests showed \u201cno illegal narcotics were involved in her death,\u201d according to an autopsy report obtained by TMZ on Tuesday from the coroner\u2019s office in Harrison County, Ind. Moran struggled with substance abuse earlier in her life, and media assumptions about her cause of death were amplified by a comment from Scott Baio during an early morning radio interview April 24. When Baio learned his former costar had been battling cancer, he fell all over himself trying to set the record straight. \u201cI was asked ONLY about Erin\u2019s troubled past due to drug & alcohol abuse. I was still upset and said I felt that living that kind of a lifestyle will catch up with you and nothing good would come of it,\u201d he said on Facebook. \u201cTHIS WAS BEFORE THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS ANNOUNCED STATING STAGE 4 CANCER.\u201d One of the former child star\u2019s brothers, Tony Moran, told the Sun on May 30: \u201cMy first thoughts were she must have had a heart attack caused by years of substance abuse. She has always battled demons and in recent years things have gone from bad to worse.\u201d In reality, as described by her husband, Moran had discovered last December that she had squamous cell carcinoma of the throat. After undergoing chemotherapy and radiation, by April she could no longer speak, eat or drink. She had a feeding tube. Baio posted the open letter from Steve Fleischmann, Moran\u2019s husband of nearly 24 years, on his own Facebook page April 25. \u201cIt got so bad so fast,\u201d Fleischmann said. \u201cThe coroner told me it was really really bad. It had spread to her spleen, she had alot of fluid in her lungs and part of her brain was infected,\u201d Fleischmann wrote. \u201cThe coroner said even if she was in the hospital being pumped full of antibiotics she still would not of made it.

Until now, the drama, from creators Misha Green and Joe Pokaski, had stood as the lone original scripted series on the network following the recent cancellation of \u201cOutsiders.\u201d The shift away from original programming comes after Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., the conservative-leaning Baltimore-based company, announced it had agreed to buy Tribune Media in a deal that would give it control of more than 200 local TV stations and WGN America. \u201cAs WGN America evolves and broadens the scope and scale of its portfolio of series, we recently announced that resources will be reallocated to a new strategy to increase our relevance within the rapidly changing television landscape,\u201d Peter Kern, president and CEO of Tribune Media, said in a statement. \u201cDespite \u2018Underground\u2019 being a terrific and important series, it no longer fits with our new direction and we have reached the difficult decision not to renew it for a third season.\u201d Kern added: \u201cIt is our hope that this remarkable show finds another home and continues its stories of courage, determination and freedom.\u201d Sony Pictures Television, the studio that produces \u201cUnderground,\u201d is said to be trying to find it a new home.

The Associated Press reported Tuesday that Lebanon is seeking to ban Warner Bros.'s new \u201cWonder Woman\u201d movie because lead actress Gal Gadot is an Israeli. On Monday, Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency reported that the Ministry of Economy and Trade was adopting measures necessary to ban the film from screening. Relations between Israel and Lebanon have been strained since Israel\u2019s independence in 1948, with Lebanon still abiding by the Arab League boycott of Israel adopted in 1945. Lebanon does not recognize the State of Israel and does not accept Israeli passports or passports indicating a person has entered Israel. But is \u201cWonder Woman\u201d an Israeli product? The film is produced by five production companies \u2014DC Films, Atlas Entertainment, Cruel and Unusual Films, Tencent Pictures and Wanda Pictures \u2014 three companies based in the United States and two in China. Gadot, however, is proud of her heritage. She served two years in the Israel Defense Force as required by the country\u2019s conscription requirements and has posted in the past in support of IDF during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict. The ban of the film would have to move quickly, as screenings are scheduled to begin in Beirut on Wednesday. But such action would require approval from a six-member committee from the Ministry of Economy, a process that had yet to begin, according to the Associated Press. \u201cWonder Woman\u201d debuts in U.S. theaters Friday. 4:10 p.m.: This article was updated with information from Lebanon\u2019s National News Agency.

Those therapies include a short course of photon radiation therapy in addition to \u201cnatural wellness therapies,\u201d the statement said. Newton-John was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992, at which time she underwent chemotherapy after a modified radical mastectomy with reconstruction. Her treatment also included acupuncture, which she said helped her with nausea, as well as yoga, meditation and massage. Three weeks ago, Newton-John postponed her May shows, with her team citing \u201ca bad issue with Olivia\u2019s sciatica.\u201d Now, her June shows in the U.S. and Canada have been put off. Ticket-holders are being directed to venues for refunds, and any rescheduled dates will be posted on Newton-John\u2019s official website. \u201cOlivia ... is confident she will be back later in the year, better than ever, to celebrate her shows,\u201d the Tuesday statement said.

Set in 1887, the film stars Judi Dench as Queen Victoria and follows the monarch as she strikes up an unlikely friendship with a Muslim Indian (Ali Fazal) who has traveled to the U.K. to deliver a ceremonial coin to her majesty. Focus, which is owned by Universal Pictures, was set to debut the trailer last Wednesday but postponed the release after the bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, on May 22. A source told The Times the decision was made in part because \u201ca big piece of marketing right after the attack could seem insensitive.\u201d Directed by Stephen Frears, \u201cVictoria & Abdul\u201d is set for release at the start of awards season in September. The trailer centers on the real-life relationship that blossomed between the two, with Abdul going from servant to teacher while informing the queen about everything from the Koran to the joys of Indian mangoes.

The syndicated series about a blended family of six children and their housekeeper has permeated the pop culture zeitgeist with its unmistakable style and earworm theme song. With numerous parodies and attempted reboots in its wake, the comedy has endured because of its wholesome values, the cast members said. \u201cWhat you have on \u2018The Brady Bunch\u2019 is something you\u2019re not going to see these days, which is a family where the parents and the kids respect each other\u2026 today the formula is get the parents out of the show for the kids shows,\u201d said Olsen, a.ka. \u201cthe youngest one in curls.\u201d \u201cYou know how you don\u2019t grow old for yourself until you see yourself in a photo? Somehow you just don\u2019t see it,\u201d Knight explained. \u201cIt\u2019s as though the show keeps us young in everyone\u2019s mind, but we\u2019re really this old.\u201d Added Williams: \u201cEveryone always refers to us as kids. No matter how we mature, we\u2019re still the kids.\u201d After acknowledging that they would always be best known for \u201cThe Brady Bunch,\u201d the actors said, they realized early on that they would never be able to walk away from the series at different stages of their careers. For Williams it was when a teenage girl asked him to sign an autograph for her mother and for Lookinland it was when he realized that his fans now had grandchildren. Knight said the show \u201cwas always going to be in the room before me and it was always going to be in the room after me.\u201d Olsen, who claimed that she had written some off-color lyrics attached to the theme song, added that \u201cyou spend a little while trying to run away from it, but you can\u2019t. It\u2019s like having a hunchback. You can\u2019t disguise it, so you might as well dress it up.\u201d As for their TV mom, Henderson, who died in 2016, the kids remembered her fondly. \u201cEveryone she met felt better about themselves and about the world around them after having spent a moment with Florence,\u201d Knight said. \u201cShe was a mentor, a friend. We learned from her,\u201d added Williams. \u201cWe learned how to interact with the public. She was so gracious with her fans, and we all learned how to do that graciously.

It makes me sad that she won\u2019t, that they will never know her.\u201d The prince was just 15 when his mother was killed in a high-speed car crash on Aug. 31, 1997, and he and younger brother Harry were left to deal with their grief under great public scrutiny. While Prince William has of late found the words to speak publicly about his mother, the journey to that place has not always been easy. \u201cIt has taken me almost 20 years to get to that stage,\u201d William said. \u201cI still find it difficult now because at the time it was so raw. And also it is not like most people\u2019s grief, because everyone else knows about it, everyone knows the story, everyone knows her.\u201d View Instagram post It may have taken years, but William and Harry have found a way to honor their mother in a fashion that she would likely greatly appreciate: charitable work. Known as the \u201cPeople\u2019s Princess,\u201d Diana was a tireless advocate for those in need and worked to destigmatize AIDS in the 1980s, to fight the use of landmines and to better the lives of the underprivileged. In the last year, William and his brother, alongside William\u2019s wife, Kate, have expanded their involvement in Heads Together, a mental health campaign led by the Royal Foundation, which aims to start a productive conversation about the reality of mental illness. \u201cSmashing the taboo is our biggest aim. We cannot go anywhere much until that is done. People can\u2019t access services till they feel less ashamed, so we must tackle the taboo, the stigma,\u201d William said. The Heads Together campaign has sparked several headlines for the royal family in recent months. In April, Prince Harry admitted that the death of his mother left him \u201cvery close to a complete breakdown\u201d for which he finally sought professional help three years ago. \u201cThe experience that I\u2019ve had is once you start talking about [mental health], you suddenly realized, actually, you\u2019re part of a big club ... and everybody\u2019s gagging to talk about it,\u201d Harry said during the \u201cMad World\u201d podcast with Bryony Gordon. The GQ interview is not the only conversation that Prince William has had recently about mental health, either. He participated in a highly publicized FaceTime chat with Lady Gaga on the matter. In the interview, Prince William acknowledged that his public persona might suggest otherwise, but privately, he is impassioned about the issue. \u201cI cannot understand how families, even behind closed doors, still find it so hard to talk about it. I am shocked we are so worried about saying anything about the true feelings we have,\u201d the prince said. Prince William\u2019s full interview with British GQ is available in its July issue, on newsstands June 1.

(Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times) The stars of Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cWonder Woman\u201d took to the red carpet outside Hollywood\u2019s Pantages Theatre Thursday night to celebrate the film\u2019s premiere with a unified message. It just wasn\u2019t the message some people might expect. \u201cI think the world needs all types of superheroes,\u201d director Patty Jenkins said when asked why we need Wonder Woman. \u201cWhat a beautiful message right now because we\u2019re in a dark place, and that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to get to the other side, if everyone becomes a hero.\u201d (Warner Bros. canceled the film\u2019s London premiere after Monday\u2019s attack in Manchester.) Despite the obvious girl power on display, many of the film\u2019s stars and creators shied away from identifying it as a feminist film, hoping not to isolate the male fans in attendance.

Disick, 34, and Thorne, 19, were seen Monday at LAX on their way to the Cannes Film Festival, where \u2014 surprise! \u2014 Kardashian, 38, was already hanging out and getting handsy with Younes Bendjima, a 24-year-old boxer-turned-model. According to E! News, the latter twosome is for real but keeping it light. The Kardashian ex and the actress from \u201cThe DUFF\u201d? Perhaps not so much. Thorne and Disick raised eyebrows Wednesday with a high-profile cuddle-fest by a pool in Cannes. Alas, by Thursday, word has it via TMZ, Thorne wasn\u2019t comfortable with her party-boy travel partner when he got his drink on: After tweeting Thursday that \u201cYo this #cannes fancy life isn\u2019t for me,\u201d she told one person that she had been doing \u201cLegit nothing trolololo\u201d with Scott and another, \u201cHahahah I\u2019m not talking to scott or anyone else.\u201d \u201cScott is partially using Bella and a few other girls as a crutch to make Kourtney upset and feel jealous,\u201d a \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\"-related source told People on Thursday, sounding like a description of an upcoming episode of the show. \u201cThey are both playing this \u2018game\u2019 with each other and at the moment neither one of them are backing down.\u201d Around 3 a.m. Friday, Cannes time, Disick was paying attention to another lady, putting this pic of his and Kardashian\u2019s 4-year-old daughter, Penelope, up on Facebook: Um, hashtag #supersad? \u201cBye Cannes you were boring\u201d Thorne said Friday on Snapchat, posting video from the seat of what appeared to be a private plane.

This is just the latest cancellation in the wake of Monday\u2019s tragedy, which took the lives of 22 individuals, including victims as young as 8 years old. On Wednesday, Warner Bros. scuttled plans for a London \u201cWonder Woman\u201d premiere, originally scheduled for May 31.

Late-night hosts remind us that Donald Trump once did that on TV By Yvonne Villarreal Lest America forget the nation\u2019s history of political candidates with body-slamming tendencies, the late-night circuit offered a refresher course Thursday night. Playing catchup to Wednesday\u2019s news that Greg Gianforte, the billionaire Republican candidate in Montana\u2019s special congressional election, had allegedly body-slammed a Guardian reporter after the journalist asked him about the Republican healthcare bill, TV hosts weighed in on the matter. \u201cThink about that,\u201d \u201cLate Night\u201d host Seth Meyers said. \u201cThe GOP healthcare plan is so bad, Republicans would rather body-slam reporters than answer a question about it. \u201cHis response to the question,\u201d Meyers continued, \u201cwas to give the reporter a preexisting condition.\u201d \u201cLate Show\u201d host Stephen Colbert expressed faux skepticism about Gianforte\u2019s ability to move past the incident and win the election. \u201cThat happened the night before the election,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how anyone could vote for a candidate who body-slams people.\u201d Cue a clip of Donald Trump performing such a move in 2007 when he appeared on \u201cWrestleMania 23\" and tackled WWE Chairman Vince McMahon to the ground before shaving his head. \u201cI forgot,\u201d Colbert said after playing the clip. \u201cNothing matters.\u201d During his \u201cA Closer Look\u201d segment, Meyers also played the Trump clip. \u201cThat was a thing, a real thing that happened. and we still said \u2018Yeah, he should be president.\u2019\u201d For the record: Gianforte won Montana\u2019s special election Thursday.

Altman / For The Times) Claire Foy\u2019s sister called her last week, none too pleased that her sibling hadn\u2019t told her that she\u2019d be playing Lisbeth Salander in \u201cThe Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web,\u201d the long-delayed follow-up to the 2011 David Fincher film \u201cThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\u201d \u201cMy sister\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, what are you doing?\u2019 and I was like, \u2018I\u2019m not doing anything!

It\u2019s very surreal.\u201d News broke last week that Foy was either \u201cin talks,\u201d \u201ceyeing\u201d or had been all but cast to play Lisbeth in the reboot of the Stieg Larsson book series. So is Foy, who plays Queen Elizabeth on \u201cThe Crown,\u201d even in the running? \u201cNo. I\u2019m not even in the same arena,\u201d Foy said. \u201cI can\u2019t even contemplate doing anything at all, to be honest, at this present time.\u201d The 33-year-old British actress just finished shooting Season 2 of \u201cThe Crown\u201d last week. The ambitious series requires a nine-month commitment, meaning that Foy hasn\u2019t had much down time the last two years. She also has a 2-year-old daughter with her husband, actor Stephen Campbell Moore. So you can understand why, when asked about her immediate future, she emphatically states: \u201cGood God, no. I have got no plans to do anything.\u201d Those sentiments would seem to preclude her from \u201cThe Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web,\u201d which is scheduled to begin filming in September to make an Oct. 15, 2018, release date. Then again, when asked what kind of role she\u2019d like to do after playing the reserved Elizabeth, a woman nicknamed \u201cShirley Temple,\u201d Foy replied: \u201cI think I need to play somebody who expresses themselves and is able to communicate on a more open level, something really different.\u201d Like the avenging anti-heroine Lisbeth? \u201cWell ...\u201d Foy answered, with a hint of a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u201d Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShow more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nCopy Link URL Copied!\n\nPrint\n\nSony taps Gina Prince-Bythewood to direct \u2018Spider-Man\u2019 spinoff \u2018Silver & Black\u2019 By Libby Hill (Ricardo DeAratanha / Los Angeles Times) Sony continues to get its superhero ducks in a row, with Deadline reporting Thursday that the studio had tapped Gina Prince-Bythewood to direct \u201cSilver & Black,\u201d a film centered around comic book characters Silver Sable and Black Cat. Prince-Bythewood also will rewrite the script for the film, originally written by Christopher Yost, screenwriter of \u201cThor: The Dark World.\u201d Silver Sable and Black Cat are characters that originated in correlation to Spider-Man and have served as both allies and antagonists to the web-slinging superhero over the years. \u201cSilver & Black\u201d is the latest Spidey-related endeavor for Sony, with \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming,\u201d starring Tom Holland, premiering July 7, and \u201cVenom,\u201d starring Tom Hardy as the sometimes villain, sometimes anti-hero, hitting theaters Oct. 5, 2018. The film will not be Prince-Bythewood\u2019s first dalliance with superheroes. She directed the pilot for Freeform\u2019s upcoming series \u201cMarvel\u2019s Cloak & Dagger,\u201d about two teenagers learning to deal with both superpowers and love. Prince-Bythewood is an experienced director of critically acclaimed films including \u201cLove & Basketball\u201d and \u201cBeyond the Lights,\u201d and she is well-versed in the world of television, where Fox\u2019s \u201cShots Fired,\u201d the show she created and produced with husband Reggie Rock Bythewood, just concluded its first season.

Having movie reviewers see it for you! Los Angeles Times critic Jen Yamato was in the Enjoy It for What It Is camp, describing the film thusly: \"[I]t not only owns its dumbness but hurtles itself all the way back around through a flurry of genitalia jokes and F-bombs to splash unapologetically in an R-rated surf of winking postmodernism, led by the charismatic Dwayne Johnson, Hollywood\u2019s most unsinkable movie star.\u201d But although not everyone hates it \u2014 64% of audiences dug it, according to Rotten Tomatoes \u2014 a lot of reviewers put the bouncing-beach-bodies flick firmly in its place, damning it, and then damning it with faint praise. That said, here are a few snacks, both bad and (relatively) good, from the \u201cBaywatch\u201d snark buffet. Over at the Chicago Tribune, they took the \u201cYeah, and ...?\u201d approach to the review. The Bad: \u201cThe movie\u2019s comic instincts... are consistently coarse and frequently scrotal.\u201d The Good: \u201cThe bodies on screen are pretty, which I seem to remember was a selling point of the 1989-2001 TV series.\u201d As we said, yeah, and ...? The Roger Ebert website perhaps cut closest to the bone, pulling few punches. The Bad: \"[T]his is another one of those raunchy comedies that\u2019s barely a movie, that looks like it was edited by dumping a bunch of footage into whatever movie-cutting software they\u2019re using and hitting \u2018randomize.\u2019\u201d The Good: \"[T]he movie has a pervading air of crass amiability about it \u2014 it\u2019s almost like a two-hour end-credits gag reel. (Nevertheless, it contains an end credits gag reel.) Now could you tell us what you really think?: Rolling Stone painted a vivid picture of the \u201cBaywatch\u201d experience. The Bad: \u201cThink of yourself sitting down for a big two-hour wallow in instant stupid with a vat of popcorn, slathered in fake butter and possibly a mound of melted M&Ms on top. It feels great chugging it down, then your stomach hurts, your head aches and you puke the whole thing up so you can forget about it in the morning. That\u2019s \u2018Baywatch\u2019 in a nutshell. Happy puking.\u201d The Good: \u201cOf the recent spate of moldy TV material morphing into movies, with \u201921 Jump Street\u2019 on top and \u2018CHIPs\u2019 bringing up the rear, \u2018Baywatch\u2019 barely escapes the basement. One reason it does: The Rock.\u201d Helpful! Turns out if you liked \u201c21 Jump Street\u201d and \u201cCHiPs,\u201d this flick is for you! The New York Times loosened up its necktie for this one. The Bad: \u201cThe digital effects \u2014 fire and water, mostly \u2014 are lackluster, and the whole thing has a crummy, overcast, second-rate-theme-park look to it.\u201d The Good: \u201cLike its source material, \u201cBaywatch\u201d is sleazy and wholesome, silly and earnest, dumb as a box of sand and slyly self-aware. It\u2019s soft-serve ice cream. Crinkle-cut fries. A hot car and a skin rash. Tacky and phony and nasty and also kind of fun.\u201d Tacky? Phony? Nasty? We didn\u2019t know it was a date movie. The Washington Post, of course, just couldn\u2019t leave politics out of it. The Bad: \u201cIt\u2019s no shock that the women in \u2018Baywatch\u2019 don\u2019t have much to do beyond look good. ... Maybe dodging bad lines was a relief for the actresses. It\u2019s not like the screenplay, by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, gives performers a lot to work with.\u201d The Good: \u201cIf, indeed, Dwayne \u2018the Rock\u2019 Johnson ditches Hollywood to become our next commander in chief, \u2018Baywatch\u2019 may be singled out as the low point of his pre-political career.\u201d Well, at least Johnson has that out of the way. The Tampa Bay Times went deadpan. The Bad: \u201cImagining Johnson and genetically gifted co-stars in swimsuits is all it took to pitch Baywatch. Director Seth Gordon and six writers didn\u2019t come up with much beyond that.\u201d The Good: \u201cWhat Baywatch has in its favor is Dwayne Johnson fireman-carrying a dead weight comedy to safety.\u201d We think that\u2019s a compliment. Maybe. Variety noted the film\u2019s nods to current market and societal trends. The Bad: \u201c\u2018Baywatch\u2019 ... is a stupidly entertaining trash folly, the kind that could only be made today: an obscenity-and-insult-laced, aggressively \u2018competent\u2019 adaptation of a 25-year-old TV show that manages to repackage every aspect of the series except, perhaps, the reason it was popular in the first place. The Good: \u201cThey wear their butt-hugging red bathing suits with dignity and pride, which makes this a highly sexually responsible \u2018Baywatch.\u2019\u201d The reviewer at the New York Post appeared to be familiar with the TV series\u2019 global success. The Bad: \u201cEven the action scenes need CPR, often undermined by effects so chintzy, you wonder if the money intended for them was instead eaten up by the production\u2019s seven-figure waxing budget.\u201d The Good: \u201cOn the bright side, it\u2019ll probably do killer business in Germany.\u201d Wait, were they just dissing the Hoff? Finally, one need go no further than the AV Club to understand Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 19% positive critics\u2019 rating. The Bad: \"[N]obody \u2014not even the filmmakers \u2014cares about \u2018Baywatch\u2019 all that much. Yet the joke\u2019s on them: In spoofing something so forgettable, they\u2019ve made something even less memorable.\u201d The Good: \u201cNobody cares about \u2018Baywatch.\u2019\u201d \u2018Nuff said.

Jimmy Kimmel focused on the seemingly less-than-happy photos of the pope with President Trump that circulated on Wednesday, while Stephen Colbert took a brief swipe at the $2-trillion double-counting error in Trump\u2019s budget. Seth Meyers, however, took advantage of his show\u2019s \u201cA Closer Look\u201d segment to make time for all of the above. After addressing the photo of the stone-faced pope with Trump, Meyers recapped the latest developments in the investigations into whether, among other things, the president engaged in obstruction of justice by firing FBI Director James Comey. But then Meyers took on the administration\u2019s proposed federal budget, which could cause harm to many. While noting the budget amounts to a wish list that Congress will battle over, Meyers said the proposal\u2019s harshness was not to be discounted. \u201cWhat someone wishes for tells you a lot about that person,\u201d Meyers said before recounting the many cuts the budget proposes to Social Security and Medicaid. The show then rolled a number of clips in which Trump the candidate promised not to do just that. \u201cThis budget lays bare just how much of a fraud Trump\u2019s campaign was,\u201d Meyers added, noting how hard many of these cuts to the social safety net would hit Trump supporters.

(Alberto Pizzoli / AFP / Getty Images) It has not been a very good year for those concerned with climate change. The U.S. is considering leaving the landmark Paris climate pact, a hostile appointee leads the Environmental Protection Agency, and right-wing websites chortle, \u201cTrump\u2019s Latest Move Will Make Al Gore Fry.\u201d But is Al Gore himself despondent or depressed about it all? Not in the slightest. \u201cI\u2019ve been inoculated in the year 2000,\u201d he says, combining a burst of genial good humor with a reference to his presidential election loss to George W. Bush. \u201cI now have a resistance to being disheartened, the antibodies are still thriving in my bloodstream. \u201cAs we all learn, one of the hidden secrets of the human condition is we learn the most from our most painful experiences.\u201d Former Vice President Al Gore at the Carlton hotel for the Cannes Film Festival, which is screening his documentary \u201cAn Inconvenient Sequel.\u201d (Stephanie Cornfield / For The Times) To spend time with Al Gore is to meet a man enough at ease with himself to dress as if for a Senate hearing in white shirt, suit and tie even though he\u2019s in the south of France; a warm, engaged, surprisingly funny individual whose innate courtesy has him personally hang a reporter\u2019s sports coat on a nearby hotel room hanger. Yes, he does tend to stay on message when he talks (how could he not) and he likes to draw graphs in the air with his hands (\u201cI\u2019m going to get a little geeky for a moment,\u201d he apologizes with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s a failing\u201d). But he combines this with good-humored self-awareness and a fiercely committed intelligence. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m earnest now, you should have seen me earlier,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t change who you are. At times I\u2019ve tried, but I\u2019m old enough to stop worrying.\u201d Gore is in Cannes to promote the worldwide release of an impassioned and involving new documentary, \u201cAn Inconvenient Sequel.\u201d Due in U.S. theaters on July 28, it brings us up to speed on where the battle against climate change stands more than a decade after the Oscar-winning documentary \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m here for a lot of to-ing and fro-ing\u201d is how Gore puts it. \u201cI think I\u2019ve done 75 seven-minute interviews \u2014 Japan, Russia, Brazil, everywhere. \u201cThe day before yesterday I was live on [the French cable channel] Canal Plus when the interpreter talking in my earpiece was evacuated from his building because of a bomb scare. The questioner was going a mile a minute in French, but because of those 75 seven-minute interviews, I picked up enough key words to fight my way through it.\u201d Gore has been concerned with climate change since he took a class with pioneering global warming theorist Roger Revelle as a college student in the 1960s. Not only did Gore \u201cnever imagine when I was a young man that this would become an all-consuming body of work for me,\u201d he also never anticipated that the work would involve the movies. More than that, he was frankly dubious about both of his films.

(Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) The body of Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, who died last week in Detroit, was reportedly cremated Tuesday in Hollywood, and a funeral is planned for later this week. Widow Vicky Cornell, brother Peter Boyle and friends Linda Ramone and singer J.D. King were at Hollywood Forever Cemetery for the cremation, sources familiar with the service told TMZ. Cornell\u2019s body was flown to Los Angeles from Detroit on Sunday, family attorney Kirk Pasich told Rolling Stone on Monday, and a private funeral will be held Friday. Pasich told Variety on Sunday that public memorials will be held \u201cwhen it\u2019s decided.\u201d The short time between the end of Soundgarden\u2019s May 17 show and 52-year-old Cornell\u2019s death was chronicled in a police report obtained by the Detroit News. He and the band walked offstage around 11:15 p.m. May 17. Fifteen minutes later Cornell was in his hotel room, the report said, where bodyguard Martin Kirsten (who used to work for and date Heidi Klum) helped him fix his computer and gave him two Ativan. At 11:35 p.m. Cornell was talking to his wife, Vicky, who said Friday through her attorney that she had been concerned because her husband was slurring his words and told her he might have taken a few too many anxiety pills. She called Kirsten at 12:15 a.m. Thursday and asked him to check on the singer, the report said; the bodyguard kicked in the hotel room door, then the locked bathroom door, and found Cornell. At his final show, Cornell seemed \u201chigh\u201d and \u201cwas out of character from note 1,\u201d lead sound engineer Ted Keedick told TMZ in an interview published Wednesday. He said the Soundgarden frontman did not appear depressed. However, Keedick said: \u201cI\u2019d never heard his voice that way before. He was having serious control problems.\u201d One concert-goer told the Detroit News last week that as far as she could tell, Cornell\u2019s final show \u201cwas honestly great.

It arrives in theaters June 2. The studio faced a similar situation last year when its European premiere of \u201cBatman v. Superman\u201d was scheduled to be held in London just hours after terrorist attacks struck Brussels, killing 32 people and injuring many others. In that case, the studio said in a statement that it had decided to go ahead with the event \u201crather than yield to terror.\u201d But as Britain mourns the 22 people killed in the Manchester bombing, with scores more wounded, and with the country\u2019s security threat level raised to its highest, signaling the possibility of another imminent attack, Warner Bros. clearly determined that the circumstances called for a different course of action.

Courtesy of billionaire inventor/playboy Tony Stark, the suit is embedded with Iron Man-style technology. A Jarvis-like computer assistant informs Peter Parker (Tom Holland) of the \u201c576 possible web shooter combinations\u201d he has at his command. A parachute can also be deployed out of the back of the suit when needed, and the chest piece can detach and turn into a drone.

Holland\u2019s Parker is clearly feeling his superhero oats, boasting to Stark of taking down a petty bike thief and raring for bigger challenges, Spanish quiz or no Spanish quiz.

We turn there for the satirical distance and perspective that might allow us to process the day and get to sleep \u2013 for laughs when laughter is appropriate, but also for a thoughtful response when events go beyond ordinary human folly to the terrible and unthinkable. Monday\u2019s suicide bombing after an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, was on the minds of some late-night hosts Tuesday night. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing you can say that can approach the shock and the grief of the victims and their families,\u201d said Stephen Colbert on \u201cLate Show,\u201d asking his audience to go online to hear what his CBS colleague James Corden, who follows him on \u201cThe Late Late Show,\u201d had to say the night before. \u201cAll we can add here,\u201d said Colbert, \u201cis that following acts of senseless violence like this, it\u2019s all the more important not to be controlled by fear, but instead to be reminded by the action of people of Manchester who rushed to the aid of their friends and strangers alike. It is just more proof that evil cannot succeed as long as good people are willing to love each other.\u201d On NBC\u2019s \u201cLate Night,\u201d host Seth Meyers had similar thoughts. \u201cAt its best, being at a concert is an incredible collective experience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance through a shared love of music to connect with, to sing with and to dance with people you don\u2019t know.... And so this comes down to the way we treat strangers, and while some cowards chose to treat strangers with hate, from everything I read, Manchester was filled with people last night who provided aid and comfort to help victims who were total strangers to them.\u201d He ended with a \u201cplea for all of us to not need a tragedy to remind us of the importance of treating those we do not know with love instead of hate.\u201d The Irish band U2, in Los Angeles to perform concerts of their own, were among Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s guests on ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live.\u201d Kimmel brought up Manchester. \u201cI imagine that is something you guys have been thinking about,\u201d he said. \u201cThey hate music, they hate women, they even hate little girls \u2013 they hate everything that we love,\u201d lead singer Bono replied. \u201cThe worst of humanity was on view in Manchester last night \u2013 but so was the best, as people took perfect strangers into their houses and queued up for blood banks. Manchester has an undefeatable spirit, I can assure you.\u201d Kimmel wondered how growing up in Northern Ireland in an era of political and sectarian violence had affected their music. \u201cIt was so commonplace for a number of years,\u201d answered the Edge, the band\u2019s guitarist, \u201cthat it just became a constant background to life. And occasionally something particularly awful would happen and it would really affect you \u2013 but that was almost the worst of it. You got to the place where [it was] just ongoing every week, every month.\u201d Punk rock helped, added Bono. \u201cIt made us suspicious of partisanship, it made us up suspicious of sectarian ideas.\u201d Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShow more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nCopy Link URL Copied!\n\nPrint\n\nElisabeth Moss and BBC America join forces for Typhoid Mary limited series By Libby Hill (Patrick T.
