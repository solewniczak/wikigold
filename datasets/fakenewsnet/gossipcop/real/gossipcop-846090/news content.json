She explains that she\u2019s \u201calways on the hunt for sustainable brands but ones that also have fashion in their veins,\u201d so naturally, she\u2019s drawn to \u201cnearly everything Reformation does, such as this button-down with a vintage vibe,\u201d she adds. \u201cBy all accounts it should feel prim and pretty, but instead with a supreme fit and slightly sheer material, it\u2019s just on the right side of hot.\u201d You have to join the waitlist to snag this blouse, but they\u2019ll email you as soon as it\u2019s available and ready to ship.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This top is currently sold out, but you can join the waitlist to get an email notification when it\u2019s back in stock.]", "images":
