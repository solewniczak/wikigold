He said it took place on his and younger brother Dylan\u2019s recent trip to Montana to climb to the top of the Continental Divide. The two had visited Glacier National Park for a Columbia Sportswear ad campaign.\n\n\u201cOut of nowhere, (we were like) \u2018Okay, that\u2019s a bear. Everybody stop\u2019. And we all stood still,\u201d Zac Efron told People. \u201cSomebody silently whispered, \u2018But it\u2019s charging at us\u2019. It took like two big canters at us.\u201d\n\nEfron said the bear eventually retreated and \u201cdisappeared behind some trees\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was the scariest part of the trip!\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was cool to see a bear that close. It was maybe 15 or 20 feet away. It was charging at us!\u201d\n\nZachary David Alexander Efron is an American actor and singer.
