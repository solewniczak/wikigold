Every free moment we can catch on a rooftop or by the pool easily becomes a reason celebrate life with pink wine\u2014the de facto drink of summer. Ros\u00e9 has served us so well in the warmer months, been a source of comfort and provided an easy way to unwind, that we don\u2019t need a special occasion to drink it, but it does deserve its very own day to shine.\n\nSaturday, June 9 is that day, where the world turns rose colored and you have an excuse to be wine drunk for as long as you want. Ros\u00e9 fanatics get special deals, events, and treats starting this weekend. Here are seven ways to celebrate National Ros\u00e9 Day.\n\nTaco Bell Berry Fros\u00e9 Twisted Freeze\n\nTaco Bell Frose Credit: Courtesy of Taco Bell\n\nThis combination of two of the best things in the world, Taco Bell and fros\u00e9, really does have me seeing the world through rose-colored glasses, but of course, it's too good to be true. The fast food take on this most coveted and trendy of all summer drinks is only available at the chain's Cantina locations in Newport Beach, California and Dearborn, Chicago.\n\nEataly Ros\u00e9 Day\n\nEataly locations around the country are celebrating this occasion with a series of decadent events: At the Boston outpost, customers can try out cannoli and ros\u00e9 pairings and the Los Angeles location will begin serving ros\u00e9 gelato. Meanwhile, the rooftop pop-up bar at Eataly Flatiron (in New York City), Serra, will serve ros\u00e9 popsicles inside a glass of sparkling wine, for a super posh take on the fros\u00e9 trend.\n\nRos\u00e9 Deodorant\n\nNative\u2014which launched a pumpkin spice deodorant last year, too\u2014is relaunching its limited-edition ros\u00e9-scented deodorant. This summery beauty product keeps you smelling fresh with a blend of floral, strawberry, and melon notes.\n\nRos\u00e9 doughnut\n\nChandon rose donut Credit: Tess Mayer\n\nChandon created a pink sparkling ros\u00e9 doughnut that comes complete with the ros\u00e9-infused glaze and buttercream filling\u2014but it\u2019s only available until June 10 at The Doughnut Project in New York City.\n\nKimpton Ros\u00e9 All Day Package\n\nRos\u00e9 All Day at Kimpton Hotels Credit: Courtesy of Kimpton The Goodland and Kimpton Canary Hotel\n\nSanta Barbara\u2019s Kimpton hotels recently launched an enticing new deal that takes the \u201cros\u00e9 all day\u201d mantra quite literally: Guests can sit by the hotel pool, sipping cans of Alloy canned ros\u00e9, and will also receive a $20 food and beverage credit. There\u2019s no better pairing for ros\u00e9 than sunshine, after all.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Ros\u00e9 Day Filter\n\nFacebook Messenger wants to help you show the world just how much you love ros\u00e9 with a custom filter that will go live on June 8.

Snap a picture to share with friends\u2014maybe of your favorite bottle, or lounging under an umbrella at your favorite rooftop bar\u2014just don\u2019t forget to grab a glass of wine first.\n\nVetro Brunch\n\nThis Queens restaurant overlooks the water, making it not only the ideal destination for a sunny day but also presents an opportunity to wear that sundress you\u2019ve been hiding in your closet. Vetro will begin hosting a Ros\u00e9 on the Bay brunch this Saturday and will continue to host it every weekend until Labor Day. You won\u2019t just get a beautiful view with brunch.
