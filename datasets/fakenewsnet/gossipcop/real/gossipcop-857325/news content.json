Among the dead are an 8-year-old girl, Saffie Roussos, and several teenagers.\n\nIn the wake of the bombing, an insider told PEOPLE that Grande is \u201cabsolutely crushed\u201d as a result of the incident.\n\n\u201cShe and her loved ones have barely slept this week,\u201d the source said.\n\nNow, in his letter, Millsaps urged the star to take all the time to herself that she needs.\n\n\u201cSpend time with your God, your family and your friends who will give you space and support when you need it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHell, go lick as many freaking donuts as you want. Girl, you deserve it!\u201d\n\nMillsaps spoke of his own children \u2014 two 12-year-olds and a 13-year-old \u2014 in the letter, noting that they often listen to Grande\u2019s music during the drive to school \u2014 \u201cI will neither confirm nor deny that I have personally seen every episode of Sam & Kat.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fgettyimages-633749702-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fgettyimages-633749702-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Char Adams", "May"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/ariana-grande-dad-open-letter-manchester-bombing/", "title": "Manchester Attack: Father Pens Moving Letter to Ariana Grande", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Ariana Grande,News", "news_keywords": "Ariana Grande,News", "description": "A Georgia father wrote an open letter to Ariana Grande in the wake of the deadly Manchester suicide bombing that killed 22 and left dozens injured", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Manchester Attack: Father Pens Moving Letter to Ariana Grande", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/ariana-grande-dad-open-letter-manchester-bombing/", "description": "A Georgia father wrote an open letter to Ariana Grande in the wake of the deadly Manchester suicide bombing that killed 22 and left dozens injured", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fgettyimages-633749702-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/music/ariana-grande-dad-open-letter-manchester-bombing/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fgettyimages-633749702-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/music/ariana-grande-dad-open-letter-manchester-bombing/", "title": "Manchester Attack: Father Pens Moving Letter to Ariana Grande", "description": "A Georgia father wrote an open letter to Ariana Grande in the wake of the deadly Manchester suicide bombing that killed 22 and left dozens injured", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fgettyimages-633749702-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/music/ariana-grande-dad-open-letter-manchester-bombing/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
