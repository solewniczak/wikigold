Additionally, Caitlyn wrote that she told Kris about her gender problems before they would make love.\n\n\u201cI told her there had been a woman inside me all my life,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe couple announced their split in 2013 and finalized their divorce in 2014. During their decades-long union, Caitlyn cross-dressed in front of her ex but was asked by Kris to do it only while traveling, so that their children wouldn\u2019t get wind of it. It was something Caitlyn grew to resent, she said, and she would steal her wife\u2019s gowns and purses to wear while traveling. (Their differing takes on their marital woes have been a topic of discussion for years.)\n\nIn a recent episode of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d Kris fumed with anger about passages in \u201cThe Secrets of My Life\u201d that claimed she knew Caitlyn was transgender before they wed.\n\n\u201cNone of it makes sense,\u201dKris said to daughters Khloe and Kim Kardashian. \u201cI read it and basically the only nice thing she had to say was that I was great socially at a party one time. ... Everything she says is all made up. Why does everything have to be that Kris is such a bitch?\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI\u2019ve never been so angry and disappointed in somebody in my whole life.\u201d\n\nIn response, the Olympic gold medalist said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that the book is \u201cextraordinarily honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is my perspective, and obviously when you do a book like that, there are different opinions. I have a lot of friends that know the truth and know what I\u2019ve been through and know the whole situation,\u201d Caitlyn said.\n\nShe told Andy Cohen that in the wake of publishing, Kris said she didn\u2019t want to talk to Caitlyn ever again. (Caitlyn also elaborated on her claims that she was a \u201cpunching bag\u201d on the show and a revelation that Kris had been in charge of her finances.)\n\n\u201cHonestly, I never had a low point [while doing the show], actually, until the other day when Kris said some of that stuff. It was the first time I was really upset,\u201d she said. \u201cI had some of the best conversations with my children on that show. ... It forces you to deal with issues. ... It forces you to sit down with your kids and deal with a lot of things.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner\u2019s second-born child with the late Robert Kardashian, shared her thoughts on the feud on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d in an episode that aired Thursday.\n\n\u201cMy heart breaks for my mom, you know, because I feel like she\u2019s been through so much and [Caitlyn is] promoting this book and she\u2019s saying all these things,\u201d Kardashian said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary and I just feel like it\u2019s unfair. Things aren\u2019t truthful.\u201d\n\nKardashian said Caitlyn was dishonest \u201cwith certain things\u201d about Kris in the book.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s taken [Caitlyn] a really long time to be honest with herself, so I don\u2019t expect her to be honest about my mom now. But it\u2019s just so hurtful,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish her all the success in the world, but not at our expense.\u201d\n\nKardashian said she and husband Kanye West have been avid supporters of Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s transition and wanted to remain respectful of her, but thought there was no need to \u201cbash\u201d the family. She said she was hurt by her stepfather, who\u2019s dad to her half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and hasn\u2019t spoken to Caitlyn in a few weeks.\n\n\u201cKendall and Kylie, that\u2019s their dad and I think my mom\u2019s been so respectful for so long and always wanting Caitlyn around and always wanting to have a great relationship with Caitlyn,\u201d Kardashian said. But that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case for the rest of the Kardashian brood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always love her. That was my stepdad for so many years. She taught me about character and so much growing up and I just feel like I don\u2019t respect the character that she\u2019s showing now.\u201d\n\nKim Kardashian\u2019s younger sister, Khloe Kardashian, is also \u201ctaking it a little tough,\u201d Caitlyn said at a book signing, according to RadarOnline. \u201cEveryone on the Jenner side is fine. All this stuff tends to work itself out!\u201d\n\nSomeone call Ryan Murphy, because this needs to be turned into a \u201cFeud\u201d series, stat.\n\n------------\n\nFOR THE RECORD\n\nApril 27, 3:31 p.m.: An earlier version of this article said Bruce Jenner and Kris Jenner finalized their divorce in 2013.
