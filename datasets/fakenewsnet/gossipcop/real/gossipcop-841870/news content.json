If I want a glass of wine I\u2019m going to have it, or some chocolate \u2014 sure why not! For me, my nutrition routine is a way of life, and I have so much energy when I exercise and eat a healthy balanced diet.\u201d\n\nBreakfast\n\n8 oz. coffee with organic creamer\n\nOvernight oats with peanut butter, cinnamon and banana\n\nSnack #1\n\nGreen juice from Mother\u2019s Market\n\nPerfect Bar or a rice cake with peanut butter\n\nLunch\n\nKale and quinoa salad with avocado, cherry tomatoes and feta or goat cheese\n\nSnack #2\n\nBlueberry muffin smoothie (Clark\u2019s recipe), with blueberries, greens, rolled oats, vanilla, cashews, chia seeds, maca powder and almond milk\n\nDinner\n\nChicken or carne asada tacos on corn tortillas\n\nTwo Nights a Week\n\nGlass of wine\n\nJustin\u2019s organic mini peanut butter cup\n\nTotal Calories:\n\n2,115\n\nThe Verdict:\n\n\u201cChristina\u2019s calories and macros are spot on for an active woman,\u201d Atlanta-based dietitian Marisa Moore says. The overnight oats at breakfast pack heart-healthy fat and protein from the peanut butter, filling fiber from the oats and banana, and the cinnamon helps keep blood sugars stable. El Moussa gets more thumbs up for her snack, though the Perfect Bar is calorie-heavy at 300 per bar. \u201cIt\u2019s inching closer to a meal replacer,\u201d Moore says. But it works in tandem with her lighter lunch, which adds more healthy fats and beta-carotene from the greens. El Moussa\u2019s dinner is \u201csatiating and a perfect way to end the day,\u201d though Moore suggests adding a vegetable slaw to round out the tacos. And she gives El Moussa a thumbs up for enjoying wine and chocolate a few times a week for \u201ca nice treat.\u201d\n\nNOTE: It is recommended that women eat at least 1,200 calories per day, and men eat at least 1,800 calories per day.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F08%2F14%2FJ.Mazziotta2334.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2F640286logo-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2F640286logo-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2F640286logo-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Mazziotta", "April"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/health/christina-el-moussa-diet-food-diary/", "title": "Christina El Moussa Diet: What I Eat in a Day", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Bodies,Christina El Moussa,Flip or Flop,Food News,Healthy Eating,News,What I Eat In A Day", "news_keywords": "Bodies,Christina El Moussa,Flip or Flop,Food News,Healthy Eating,News,What I Eat In A Day", "description": "Flip or Flop's Christina El Moussa documents her meals for a day, which got a boost when she started working with a nutritionist", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Christina El Moussa Diet: What I Eat in a Day", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/health/christina-el-moussa-diet-food-diary/", "description": "Flip or Flop's Christina El Moussa documents her meals for a day, which got a boost when she started working with a nutritionist", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2F640286logo-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/health/christina-el-moussa-diet-food-diary/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2F640286logo-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/health/christina-el-moussa-diet-food-diary/", "title": "Christina El Moussa Diet: What I Eat in a Day", "description": "Flip or Flop's Christina El Moussa documents her meals for a day, which got a boost when she started working with a nutritionist", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2F640286logo-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/health/christina-el-moussa-diet-food-diary/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
