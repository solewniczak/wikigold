He captioned the tweet, \u201cInspired by Emma.\u201d\n\nGonzalez, who has openly rebuked Trump and called for stricter gun laws in the country since the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting on Feb. 14 that killed 17 people, did not return West\u2019s compliment. Copying the format of West\u2019s tweet, she paid tribute to James Shaw Jr., who attacked a gunman who fatally opened fire at a Tennessee Waffle House restaurant on April 22 and likely saved lives by wrestling the assault-style rifle out of the assailant\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with trump [sic] but the mob can\u2019t make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI love everyone. I don\u2019t agree with everything anyone does. That\u2019s what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

I get along with a lot of people, frankly,\u201d the president said during a phone interview on Fox and Friends. \u201cKanye looks, and he sees black unemployment at the lowest it\u2019s been in the history of our country, okay? He sees Hispanic unemployment at the lowest it\u2019s been in the history of our country. He sees, by the way, female unemployment the lowest it\u2019s been in now almost 19 years.\u201d\n\nThe president continued: \u201cHe sees that stuff, and he\u2019s smart. He says, \u2018Trump is doing a much better job than the Democrats did.\u2019\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Man Hailed as a \u2018Hero\u2019 for Disarming Waffle House Shooter During Attack: \u2018I\u2019m Glad I Acted\u2019\n\nAfter disarming the gunman at a Nashville-area Waffle House restaurant on April 22, Shaw set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for the victims\u2019 families. After six days, the page had raised over $190,000.\n\nShaw told reporters that he was \u201csore\u201d from the altercation, in addition to having been grazed by a bullet on his arm and receiving burns on his hand from grabbing the rifle\u2019s barrel. However, he was more concerned with the victims.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s four families that are grieving right now. So much life was lost for no reason,\u201d he said, according to CNN. \u201cI feel like it could be very selfish of me if I didn\u2019t point it out. And I apologize.\u201d\n\nShaw told Today that he later learned that the gunman had other magazines and could have reloaded if he hadn\u2019t stopped him.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fkanye-west4-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fkanye-west4-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit", "April"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/emma-gonzalez-dismisses-kanye-west-calling-her-hero-praises-james-shaw-jr/", "title": "Kanye West Calls Emma Gonzalez His 'Hero' \u2014 but She Dismisses It by Praising Waffle House Hero", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Florida High School Shooting,Kanye West,News", "news_keywords": "Florida High School Shooting,Kanye West,News", "description": "Just days after Kanye West tweeted of his support for President\u00a0Donald Trump, he shared a photo of Emma Gonz&aacute;lez and referred to her as \"my hero\"", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Kanye West Calls Emma Gonzalez His 'Hero' &mdash; but She Dismisses It by Praising Waffle House Hero", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/emma-gonzalez-dismisses-kanye-west-calling-her-hero-praises-james-shaw-jr/", "description": "Just days after Kanye West tweeted of his support for President\u00a0Donald Trump, he shared a photo of Emma Gonz&aacute;lez and referred to her as \"my hero\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fkanye-west4-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/music/emma-gonzalez-dismisses-kanye-west-calling-her-hero-praises-james-shaw-jr/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fkanye-west4-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/music/emma-gonzalez-dismisses-kanye-west-calling-her-hero-praises-james-shaw-jr/", "title": "Kanye West Calls Emma Gonzalez His 'Hero' &mdash; but She Dismisses It by Praising Waffle House Hero", "description": "Just days after Kanye West tweeted of his support for President\u00a0Donald Trump, he shared a photo of Emma Gonz&aacute;lez and referred to her as \"my hero\"", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fkanye-west4-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/music/emma-gonzalez-dismisses-kanye-west-calling-her-hero-praises-james-shaw-jr/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
