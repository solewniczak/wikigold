That would be Jimmy Fallon\u2019s What\u2019s Behind Me? game.\n\nReminiscent of a Who\u2019s Line Is It Anyway? bit from way back when, Fallon and guest Tina Fey had to take turns getting the other to guess what absurd thing was standing behind them. The first round saw King Kong holding a hot dog in a top hat, and the second round saw this Ghost-ly monstrosity.\n\nAs Fallon said, \u201cYou can\u2019t unsee that.\u201d But, Fey joked, \u201cIt\u2019s surprisingly sexy.\u201d\n\nFey, a Tony nominee for her Mean Girls Broadway musical, didn\u2019t realize there would be actual actors acting out these ridiculous scenes. \u201cThat guy\u2019s at work right now,\u201d she joked, pointing to the hot dog. \u201cThat\u2019s his job.\u201d\n\nThe comedienne will return to her old Saturday Night Live stomping grounds this weekend to host the season finale. A former writer and cast member for the late-night sketch comedy series, Fey is already a member of the elite Five-Timer\u2019s Club. This Saturday will mark her sixth time hosting, and she\u2019ll be accompanied by Nicki Minaj as the musical guest.\n\nWatch her play What\u2019s Behind Me? in the video above.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F04%2F09%2Fnick-romano-image.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F05%2Ffallon-fey-2-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F05%2Ffallon-fey-2-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Romano", "May", "At Am Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/18/tina-fey-jimmy-fallon-whats-behind-me/", "title": "Tina Fey plays a game involving two E.T.s recreating the Ghost pottery scene", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Jimmy Fallon,Last Night on Late Night,Tina Fey", "news_keywords": "Jimmy Fallon,Last Night on Late Night,Tina Fey", "description": "Tina Fey plays a game involving two E.T.s recreating the Ghost\u00a0pottery scene", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Tina Fey plays a game involving two E.T.s recreating the 'Ghost' pottery scene", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/18/tina-fey-jimmy-fallon-whats-behind-me/", "description": "Tina Fey plays a game involving two E.T.s recreating the Ghost\u00a0pottery scene", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F05%2Ffallon-fey-2-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/18/tina-fey-jimmy-fallon-whats-behind-me/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F05%2Ffallon-fey-2-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/18/tina-fey-jimmy-fallon-whats-behind-me/", "title": "Tina Fey plays a game involving two E.T.s recreating the 'Ghost' pottery scene", "description": "Tina Fey plays a game involving two E.T.s recreating the Ghost\u00a0pottery scene", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F05%2Ffallon-fey-2-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/18/tina-fey-jimmy-fallon-whats-behind-me/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9NOwaiXqqA"], "publish_date": 1526594400.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
