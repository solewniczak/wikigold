{"url": "https://uproxx.com/music/taylor-swift-delicate-behind-the-scenes-stripped-back/", "text": "Taylor Swift\u2019s newest album Reputation is full of many more pop-oriented twists and turns than anything she\u2019s ever released before, including her 2014 hit 1989, and the latest behind-the-scenes video she\u2019s shared details the making of one of the most processed and manipulated songs on the album.\n\nAll the vocal processing on \u201cDelicate\u201d is stripped back in the first part of three clips that Taylor shared last night, as she sings the song unadorned into the mic, and then gets a snippet of it back with the kind of vocal effects added that most of us still associate with Imogen Heap.\n\nIn the second clip, above, she tries to parse out where the rhythms on a particularly syncopated section is, and notices the camera right at the end of the filming session. The final clip gets much more goofy, as Taylor, Shellback (the producer name of Karl Johan Schuster), and Max Martin are almost finished with their creation, and begin to get a little goofy. Toward the end of this clip, Taylor flips the camera around so fans can see the recording studio, and notes the dancing and silliness \u201cmeans he likes it!\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why, too, though Reputation is easily Taylor\u2019s most flawed album to date, \u201cDelicate\u201d is one of the standouts. Listen below if you haven\u2019t heard it yet.", "images": ["https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/jail-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1",
