It's all about the core workouts\u2014and she's sharing a look at one on Instagram.\n\nSarah Stage has made headlines over and over again for maintaining her six-pack abs while pregnant\u2014and the fitness model showed us all what her workout routine really entails while expecting her second child in June 2017.\n\nThe mama shared a clip of one of her prenatal workouts on her Instagram page, and it's a really eye-opening look at how hard she works to stay as fit as possible. It's important to remember that every woman is different before, during and after pregnancy\u2014and while Stage is still rocking her six-pack despite the fact that she's six months pregnant, that's not to say that all pregnant women should strive to look the way she does.\n\nBut this mama's commitment to living a healthy lifestyle throughout her pregnancy? Well, it's pretty commendable.\n\nStage makes one thing very clear: She's not putting her baby at risk by keeping up with these challenging prenatal workouts. Stage points out that she got the go-ahead from her doctor to keep exercising during pregnancy, which is really all that matters\u2014and any flack she's faced from social media users isn't cool in light of that. With that being said, Stage also reiterates that every pregnant lady has a different situation, and that there's no one-size-fits-all fitness situation that'll work for everyone. So if you want to work out like this fit preggo, talk to your doctor before you give this workout a go. (Stage also published a fitness ebook if you want to try out her full routine.)", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F38%2F2022%2F02%2F08%2FZara-Hanawalt.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F38%2F2015%2F10%2F12220956%2FGettyImages-543767951.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F38%2F2021%2F01%2F04%2Ftoo-cute-cootie-catcher-848a1ec5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F38%2F2013%2F04%2F12212409%2Fshutterstock_488651425.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F38%2F2019%2F06%2F28134754%2Ftwo-moms-holding-children-f6b7869a.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F38%2F2019%2F06%2F12213514%2Fbarre_0.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F38%2F2015%2F07%2F14%2Fp_101365232.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F38%2F2016%2F02%2F21%2Fpregnant-woman-with-back-pain.jpg", "https://www.fitpregnancy.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F38%2F2021%2F09%2F24%2FGettyImages-1271146277-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F38%2F2019%2F06%2F25153528%2Fchild-gardening-with-dog-ecfcae49.jpg", "https://www.fitpregnancy.com/img/misc/300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F38%2F2015%2F06%2F01220038%2FBullyproof-children_copy.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F38%2F2013%2F04%2F12212607%2FV4MjF5NDE6sYgJb6iEbxbPjKCD0jQBT_.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F38%2F2019%2F06%2F12213514%2Fbarre_0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zara Hanawalt", "December"], "canonical_link": "https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/my-body/fitness/pregnant-six-pack-mom-reveals-her-impressive-workout-routine/", "title": "Fitness Model Mom Reveals Her Impressive Six-Pack Ab Workout", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Want to know how Sarah Stage has a six-pack while six months pregnant?
