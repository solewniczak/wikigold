To say he \u2018ran over\u2019 or \u2018hit\u2019 the guy is misleading and an overstatement and implies something much more grave than what happened,\u201d a source close to Bieber tells PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cJustin immediately stopped, called 911 himself, stayed with the guy and the police, fully cooperated and as I understand it, was released from the scene without citation.\u201d\n\nA rep for Bieber had no comment.\n\njustin-bieber-4-2000 Credit: All Access/SPW/Splash\n\njustin-bieber-3-2000 Credit: All Access/SPW/Splash\n\nAlso pictured at the scene: Bieber\u2019s former fling Kourtney Kardashian, who occasionally attends the church as well.

Isn\u2019t that something? He\u2019s a good kid, though.
