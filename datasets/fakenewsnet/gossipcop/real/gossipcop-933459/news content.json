It's believed she has lost 30 pounds in the weeks since giving birth and is in the midst of returning to an tweaked version of her normal exercise routine to be more gentle on her body.\n\nIn 2014, Khloe famously began her physical transformation and dropped a whopping 40 pounds and four dress sizes. These days, she's inching her way back into healthy eating, writing on her website that she's one a low carb diet which includes \"one tablespoon of jam and one tablespoon of almond butter\" in the morning.\n\n\"It has lots of protein, so I'm able to go all out at the gym, but the best part is that I'm never hungry because I'm always eating,\" she wrote. After her morning workout, she eats two eggs, one cup of oatmeal and one cup of berries.\n\nExpand Close Tristan Thompson and Khloe Kardashian attend the Klutch Sports Group \"More Than A Game\" Dinner Presented by Remy Martin at Beauty & Essex on February 17, 2018 in Los Angeles, California.

For lunch, she has a grilled chicken breast with salad, including choice vegetables like spinach, asparagus and broccoli.\n\nBy dinnertime, her nutritionist Dr Philip Goglia recommends an eight-ounce piece of fish with four ounces of sweet potatoes.\n\nEarlier this month, Khloe shared her excitement at being able to return to the gym for the first time since giving birth, which was met with mixed crticism.\n\n\"What I\u2019m annoyed about is that I\u2019ve read a couple of times on Twitter that they feel that I\u2019m focusing too much on my body, but the truth is, I've worked out five or six days a week before I got pregnant and that\u2019s my sanctuary and something I love to do,\" she said on Snapchat.\n\n\"I want to start doing that now and getting into my rhythm and in between feedings I want to find time to work out because that\u2019s going to be my new normal. Just because I have a baby, doesn't mean I have to stop doing the things that I love, and I love working out and getting my mind right.\"\n\nFamily friend Chrissy Teigen famously said in 2016 that women should never compare themselves to celebrities after birth, because they have the time and money to achieve their goals quicker.\n\nExpand Close Khloe Kardashian shared this picture of her baby daughter True Thompson.

We have people who make it possible for us to get back into shape. But nobody should feel like that's normal, or like that's realistic.\"", "images": ["https://www.independent.ie/videos/5d448/41447639.ece/AUTOCROP/w220h124/4711776-1647328963522794_10.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/a654c/36796292.ece/AUTOCROP/h530/khloe.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/e6d5c/36982216.ece/AUTOCROP/h530/4CF0639200000578-5807583-image-a-15_1528210715117.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/videos/a787b/41448486.ece/AUTOCROP/w220h124/4711957-1647343531339870_10.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/videos/ee9b8/41444669.ece/AUTOCROP/w220h124/4711093-1647256784217985_10.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/6217d/36982215.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/4CF03DD600000578-5807583-image-m-14_1528210669991.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/81889/36796294.ece/AUTOCROP/h530/khloe2.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/videos/c0a83/41447641.ece/AUTOCROP/w220h124/4711779-1647329104661480.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/54fe4/36796293.ece/AUTOCROP/h530/khloe1.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/f000f/36814897.ece/AUTOCROP/h530/GettyImages-919969056.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/b1de5/36982214.ece/AUTOCROP/h530/4CF019F000000578-5807583-image-a-13_1528210650022.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/6217d/36982215.ece/AUTOCROP/h530/4CF03DD600000578-5807583-image-m-14_1528210669991.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/e587d/36978609.ece/AUTOCROP/w300h168/brody-jenner-wedding.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/4b130/36892587.ece/AUTOCROP/w300h168/ipanews_c63ce9dd-2e5d-4cc7-92b6-f0c682157206_1", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/2d9de/36979266.ece/AUTOCROP/w300h168/barron-hilton-wedding-full.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/3d442/36932494.ece/AUTOCROP/w300h168/ipanews_b46fa53e-4cb5-460f-99f3-52488b56e517_1", "https://www.independent.ie/videos/e382d/41445985.ece/AUTOCROP/w220h124/4711490-1647276414826610.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/3c6df/36796295.ece/AUTOCROP/w620/khloe3.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/6217d/36982215.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/4CF03DD600000578-5807583-image-m-14_1528210669991.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.ie/style/beauty/body/khloe-kardashian-reveals-her-low-carb-post-baby-diet-after-losing-30-pounds-since-birth-of-daughter-true-36982212.html", "title": "Khloe Kardashian reveals her low-carb post-baby diet after 'losing 30 pounds' since birth of daughter True", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover", "google-signin-client_id": "726696172496-90eva72em9kilt5siidtbppm234tq0sh.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Khloe Kardashian has opened up about the diet she's relying on to fuel her life as a new mother, just weeks after she hit back at critics who took aim at her for exercising too much.", "fb": {"pages": 96796398469, "app_id": 714861305308164}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=335158729, app-argument=https://www.independent.ie/style/beauty/body/khloe-kardashian-reveals-her-low-carb-post-baby-diet-after-losing-30-pounds-since-birth-of-daughter-true-36982212.html", "og": {"title": "Khloe Kardashian reveals her low-carb post-baby diet after 'losing 30 pounds' since birth of daughter True", "site_name": "independent", "description": "Khloe Kardashian has opened up about the diet she's relying on to fuel her life as a new mother, just weeks after she hit back at critics who took aim at her for exercising too much.", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/style/beauty/body/khloe-kardashian-reveals-her-low-carb-post-baby-diet-after-losing-30-pounds-since-birth-of-daughter-true-36982212.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/6217d/36982215.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/4CF03DD600000578-5807583-image-m-14_1528210669991.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/6217d/36982215.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/4CF03DD600000578-5807583-image-m-14_1528210669991.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1240, "height": 700}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Independent_ie", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/style/beauty/body/khloe-kardashian-reveals-her-low-carb-post-baby-diet-after-losing-30-pounds-since-birth-of-daughter-true-36982212.html", "title": "Khloe Kardashian reveals her low-carb post-baby diet after 'losing 30 pounds' since birth of daughter True", "description": "Khloe Kardashian has opened up about the diet she's relying on to fuel her life as a new mother, just weeks after she hit back at critics who took aim at her for exercising too much.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/6217d/36982215.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/4CF03DD600000578-5807583-image-m-14_1528210669991.jpg", "alt": "Khloe Kardashian shared this picture of her after giving birth earlier this year.
