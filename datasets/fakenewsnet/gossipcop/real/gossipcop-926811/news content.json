Jordin Sparks and Dana Isaiah's Son DJ Has 'Bonded' the Newlyweds\n\n\u201cWe went from being two individuals to being one to preparing to bring a child into this world,\u201d Isaiah, 26, tells PEOPLE exclusively about becoming parents to son DJ on May 2 just 10 months after he and Sparks eloped. \u201cIt was a real whirl.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nThough the newlyweds \u2014 who met for the first time last April and wed during an impromptu wedding ceremony in Hawaii three months later \u2014 were understandably overwhelmed when they first found out they were expecting a baby, they dived head-first into preparing for parenthood.\n\njordin-sparks2 Jordin Sparks, Dana Isaiah and DJ | Credit: Coral Von Zumwalt\n\nWatch the full episode of People Features: Jordin Sparks \u2013 And Baby Makes Three, streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s transformed both of us,\u201d the singer, 28, says about expanding their family. \u201cI feel like as humans we should always be trying to be better and trying to grow. With him, it\u2019s just expedited the process. I already know that Dana\u2019s infinitely better and I\u2019m infinitely better just because DJ\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nSparks also leaned on her husband when she got emotional during the first few months of pregnancy and in the difficult weeks after giving birth.\n\njordin-sparks1 Dana Isaiah, Jordin Sparks and DJ | Credit: Coral Von Zumwalt\n\n\u201cI was crying all the time and I was anxious too,\u201d she says about the unexpected wave of emotions that hit her after the couple brought DJ home. \u201cMy chest would feel really tight. The thought of taking him out of the house was scary. I wasn\u2019t ready for all those different things.\u201d\n\nWith the support of Isaiah, however, the star is now in a \u201cbetter\u201d place emotionally.\n\n\u201cFor moms, they do carry a lot bigger load, so you can understand,\u201d says Isaiah. \u201cYou go through nine, 10 months of carrying him, then he comes and you\u2019re just like, \u2018I have to leave him\u2019 when he\u2019s been attached to you the entire time. That can be a lot.\u201d\n\njordin-sparks3 Dana Isaiah, Jordin Sparks and DJ | Credit: Coral Von Zumwalt\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Meet Jordin Sparks\u2019 Son DJ!
