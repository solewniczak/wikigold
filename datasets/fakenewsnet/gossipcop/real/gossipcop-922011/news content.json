What is broadcast journalism when the news is entertainment and entertainment is news? Cohen is a pseudo-David Letterman for the era of reality television. While David Letterman got his start as a radio host, Cohen began as a behind the scenes producer of the news. According to Cohen's memoir Most Talkative: Stories from the Front Lines of Pop Culture, Cohen worked for more than 10 years at CBS, where he started as an intern. (This is, for someone who now sips martinis on TV each night, a fairly banal start to his career. Who stays somewhere for 10 years anymore?) By the end of his tenure there, Cohen was a senior producer.", "images": ["https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a70678be6c693f8a9915bec2fa49ee49.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/c5a8ae3dd50e6ebe17044593c2c7ee0c.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg", "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/entry/8d9/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1944310/image.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/entry/8d9/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1944310/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ineye Komonibo", "Alice Porter", "Qali Id", "Venesa Coger", "Mercedes Viera", "Kathleen Newman-B...", "Elexus Jionde", "Hanna Phifer", "How Andy Cohen Became Famous And Ended Up On Riverdale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/03/194394/andy-cohen-fame-success-story-bravo-host", "title": "How Andy Cohen Became Famous Enough To End Up On Riverdale", "meta_data": {"title": "How Andy Cohen Became Famous And Ended Up On Riverdale", "description": "These days, he's ubiquitous.
