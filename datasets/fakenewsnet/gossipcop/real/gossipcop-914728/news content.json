Justin flew on a private jet to L.A. to see Jen one last time.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nThe insider adds that the former couple were divided on when to announce the breakup news, with the Friends star hoping to continue to keep the matter private.\n\n\u201cJen didn\u2019t want to announce it for as long as possible, because she wanted to avoid the media attention,\u201d the source says.\n\nThe couple\u2019s decision to split comes just days after the actress\u2019s 49th birthday, which she and Theroux spent apart. Aniston celebrated in Malibu, California, with a gathering alongside pals Courteney Cox, Andrea Bendewald, Leigh Kilton-Smith and Kristin Hahn on Feb. 11.\n\n\u201cJen hoped that Justin would be low-key on her birthday so people weren\u2019t wondering why he wasn\u2019t with her. But that\u2019s not Justin\u2019s style,\u201d the insider continues. \u201cHe wanted to make the announcement so he can live his life.\u201d\n\nScott Campbell & Saved Wines Host: A Dinner to Celebrate Wholte Glory, New York, America - 15 Nov 2015 Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston | Credit: Joe Schildhorn/BFA.com/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe pair announced their split after seven years together and two and a half years of marriage with a statement released by Aniston\u2019s longtime publicist on Thursday: \u201cIn an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\u201d\n\n\u201cNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,\u201d their statement continued. \u201cWhatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else\u2019s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another. \u201d\n\nThe Aniston source says Theroux, 46, had been over the relationship for quite some time.\n\n\u201cIt seems Justin gave up many months ago,\u201d the insider explains. \u201cFor the past few months, he has spent very little time in L.A. Jen very recently started telling people that they were over. She seems okay now, but was still hoping as of a few weeks ago that they could figure things out.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux Were the Picture Perfect Couple During Their Last Vacation\n\nA source told PEOPLE shortly before the breakup that Aniston and Theroux\u2019s differing personalities and interests had put a strain on their marriage.\n\nThey are \u201cvery different people,\u201d the source said.\n\nOn top of work demands keeping them apart, Aniston spent most of her time in Los Angeles with her close-knit group of friends in the months leading to their separation, while Theroux often visited New York City.\n\n\u201cJennifer loves her life in Los Angeles, and if anything, she has grown more attached to being there,\u201d said an entertainment source. \u201cJustin is not that comfortable or happy in Los Angeles all the time. He loves New York and always has.\u201d\n\n20th Annual Critics' Choice Movie Awards - Red Carpet Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux | Credit: Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nAniston and Theroux first met on the Hawaii set of 2008\u2019s Tropic Thunder and began dating in 2011.
