The first recorded record transfer was of Willie Groves from West Bromwich Albion to Aston Villa for \u00a3100 in 1893[1] (equivalent to \u00a311,000 in 2020). This occurred just eight years after the introduction of professionalism by the Football Association in 1885.[2] The current transfer record was set by the transfer of Neymar from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain for \u20ac222 million (\u00a3190 million) in August 2017.[3][4]\n\nMost of the transfers on this list are to clubs under UEFA's jurisdiction, and most of the purchasing clubs are from England, France, Italy and Spain. Manchester City of England appears on this list eight times each, the most of any club.\n\nRomelu Lukaku appears on this list three times for moves to Manchester United, Internazionale and Chelsea. Two players appear on the list twice: \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Cristiano Ronaldo. All of the players on the list are of European (UEFA), South American (CONMEBOL), North America (CONCACAF) and African (CAF) origin. Following the transfer of American Christian Pulisic of the CONCACAF confederation in 2019, there are currently no players on the list from the remaining regions; Asia (AFC) and Oceania (OFC).\n\nAs of 28 January 2022\n\nFee broke the world football transfer record at the time of the transfer\n\nFee broke the record for a teenager at the time of the transfer\n\nFee broke the national league record at the time of the transfer\n\nFee broke the record for a Fee broke the record for a South American player at the time of the transfer\n\nFee broke the record for an Fee broke the record for an African player at the time of the transfer\n\nFee broke the record for a Fee broke the record for a North American player at the time of the transfer\n\nFee broke the record for a goalkeeper at the time of the transfer\n\nFee broke the record for a defender at the time of the transfer\n\nNotes\n\na b c d e f g This transfer was carried out by the purchasing club paying the player's buyout clause , against the will of the origin club. ^ On loan since 2017, permanent move in July 2018 ^ Initial \u00a3105 million plus reported \u00a337 million bonuses ^ Initial \u20ac105 million plus reported \u20ac40 million bonuses ^ Fee was to be paid over time with an initial \u20ac105 million, plus another \u20ac5 million in additional bonuses; Pogba's agent Mino Raiola also received a reported \u20ac27 million from Juventus, from a portion of aforementioned transfer fee from Manchester United. ^ Initial \u00a389 million plus reported \u00a360 million bonuses ^ Fee was to be paid over time with an initial \u00a375 million, plus another \u00a315 million in additional bonuses. ^ The deal includes \u00a35m in add-ons. ^ [31] fee originally in 150 billion lire ; the fixed exchange rate between euro and lire was 1:1936.27. The fee was paid in 4 annual instalments; on accounting purpose, the fee was listed as approximately \u20ac75m ^ Initial \u20ac75 million, payable in 5 financial years, plus additional \u20ac10,5 million broker fee ^ Initial \u20ac75 million plus reported \u20ac11 million bonuses ^ Initial \u20ac72 million plus reported \u20ac10 million bonuses ^ Initial fee of \u20ac70 million with reported performance related bonuses of \u20ac10 million. ^ Barcelona paid \u20ac49.5 million, and exchanged Samuel Eto'o valued at \u20ac20 million. ^ The fee broke the world record in pound sterling, but not in euro (Zinedine Zidane was the most expensive in euro at that time); as the fee was paid in installments, the accountant that prepared the financial report adjusted the value to \u20ac66.073 million as the present value to reflect the loss in interest ^ Fee was to be paid over time with an initial \u00a358 million, plus another \u00a312 million in additional bonuses. ^ Cancelo's transfer equates to \u20ac65 million as part-exchange deal, where Danilo would be sent to Juventus. ^ Initial fee of \u00a356 million with reported performance related bonuses of \u00a39 million. ^ Fee was to be paid over time with an initial \u00a344 million, plus another \u00a35 million in additional bonuses.\n\nThe first player to ever be transferred for a fee of over \u00a3100 was Scottish striker Willie Groves when he together with Jack Reynolds (\u00a350) made the switch from West Bromwich Albion to Aston Villa in 1893,[2] eight years after the legalisation of professionalism in the sport. It took just another twelve years for the figure to become \u00a31000, when Sunderland striker Alf Common moved to Middlesbrough.[63][64]\n\nIt was not until 1928 that the first five-figure transfer took place. David Jack of Bolton Wanderers was the subject of interest from Arsenal, and in order to negotiate the fee down, Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman got the Bolton representatives drunk.[65][66] Subsequently, David Jack was transferred for a world record fee when Arsenal paid \u00a310,890 to Bolton for his services, after Bolton had asked for \u00a313,000, which was double the previous record made when Sunderland signed Burnley's Bob Kelly a fee of for \u00a36,500.[64]\n\nThe first player from outside Great Britain to break the record was Bernab\u00e9 Ferreyra, a player known as La Fiera for his powerful shot. His 1932 transfer from Tigre to River Plate cost \u00a323k,[66] and the record would last for 17 years (the longest the record has lasted) until it was broken by Manchester United's sale of Johnny Morris to Derby County for \u00a324k in March 1949. The record was broken seven further times between 1949 and 1961, when Luis Su\u00e1rez Miramontes was sold by FC Barcelona to Inter Milan for \u00a3152k, becoming the first ever player sold for more than \u00a3100k.[64]\n\nIn 1968, Pietro Anastasi became the first \u00a3500k player when Juventus purchased him from Varese,[66] which was followed seven years later with Giuseppe Savoldi becoming the first million pound player when he transferred from Bologna to Napoli.[64][66]\n\nAfter Alf Common and David Jack, the third player to twice be transferred for world record fees is Diego Maradona.[64][66] His transfers from Boca Juniors to Barcelona for \u00a33m, and then to Napoli for \u00a35m, both broke the record in 1982 and 1984 respectively. The most recent is Ronaldo with his record-breaking move from PSV Eindhoven to Barcelona in 1996 for \u00a313.2m, although Alan Shearer's transfer to Newcastle broke the record the same summer. A year later Inter Milan paid \u00a319.5m for Ronaldo and again he became the player with the highest transfer fee.\n\nIn the space of 61 days in 1992,[66] three transfers broke the record,[64] all by Italian clubs: Jean-Pierre Papin transferred from Marseille to A.C. Milan, becoming the first ever \u00a310m player.[66] Almost immediately, rivals Juventus topped that with the signing of Gianluca Vialli for a fee of \u00a312m from Sampdoria. Milan then completed the signing of Gianluigi Lentini for a fee of \u00a313m which stood as the record for three years.\n\nThe 1996 transfer of Alan Shearer from Blackburn Rovers to Newcastle United, for a fee of \u00a315m,[68] kickstarted a year-by-year succession of record breaking transfers: Ronaldo moved the following year to Inter Milan from FC Barcelona for a fee of \u00a317m,[69] which was followed in 1998 by the shock transfer of his fellow countryman Den\u00edlson from S\u00e3o Paulo to Real Betis for a fee of approximately \u00a321m.[64][66][70]\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, Italian clubs returned to their record-breaking ways, with Christian Vieri transferring from Lazio to Inter Milan for \u00a328m,[71] while Hern\u00e1n Crespo's transfer from Parma to Lazio ensured he became the first player to cost more than \u00a330m.[64][72] The transfer prompted the BBC to ask \"has the world gone mad\"?[73] It took two weeks for the record to be broken when Lu\u00eds Figo made a controversial \u00a337m move from Barcelona to rivals Real Madrid.[64][74] A year later, Real increased the record again with a signing of Zinedine Zidane for \u00a348 million (150 billion lire).[75]\n\nZidane's record stood for 8 years, the longest since the 1940s. Real Madrid continued with the Gal\u00e1cticos policy by buying Kak\u00e1 from Milan for \u20ac67 million (\u00a356 million),[76] which was the world record in pound sterling. However, both world record in euro and in pound sterling were broke by Real themselves when signing Cristiano Ronaldo for \u00a380m (\u20ac94m) from Manchester United in the same transfer window,[64][77] 4 years later Real Madrid broke the record again after completed the signing of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013. Although Real initially insisted that the transfer cost \u20ac91.59 million, slightly less than the Ronaldo fee, the deal was widely reported to be around \u20ac100 million (around \u00a385.1 million).[78][79] Documents leaked in 2016 by Football Leaks revealed that instalments brought the final Bale fee up to a total of \u20ac100,759,418.[64][80] In 2016, Manchester United eventually took the record away from Real Madrid, signing French midfielder Paul Pogba for \u20ac105 million (\u00a389 million),[81] four years after having released him to Juventus for training compensation.\n\nA year after the Pogba transfer, however, there was a major jump in the record fee. Paris St. Germain matched the \u20ac222 million buyout fee of Barcelona's Neymar, converted to a reported \u00a3198 million by different sources,[4] or \u00a3200 million[3] more than double the previous record. This was the first time that the record fee was paid by a French club.\n\nHistorical progression [ edit ]\n\nNumber of record players by country [ edit ]\n\nCountry Player records Record selling
