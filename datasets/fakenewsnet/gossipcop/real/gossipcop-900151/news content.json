In the video, Keaton revealed that the bullies, \u201cmake fun of my nose. They call me ugly. They say I have no friends.\u201d\n\nHowever, Keaton\u2019s emotional story took a turn when photos surfaced showing the family with Confederate flags. They faced more criticism when rumors circulated that the family used Keaton\u2019s story for financial gain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said over and over, I\u2019m an adult, I know who I am. I\u2019m obviously sorry that it has offended so many people, but the backlash to my children\u2026\u201d Kimberly said during the morning show. \u201cThat\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019t wish on anybody.\u201d\n\nShe added that the backlash has \u201cbrought the bullies out.\u201d Kimberly also denied being racist in interviews with ABC and CBS News.\n\nAs the backlash seemingly began to subside, the family faced a new wave of criticism as photos from the Facebook page of Shawn White, Keaton\u2019s allegedly estranged father, showed him sharing white supremacist propaganda. The pictures prompted Keaton\u2019s older sister, Lakyn Jones, to defend her family in a tweet.\n\nHenry Winkler Offers a Powerful Message Following Tennessee Student\u2019s Viral Anti-Bullying Video\n\n\u201cYou all can go look back at every tweet from every father\u2019s & mother\u2019s day to see that all we have is our mom,\u201d Lakyn wrote on her Twitter account on Wednesday. \u201cWe have no contact with our dads. BECAUSE of their actions. That\u2019s why all the articles say \u2018estranged\u2019 because we don\u2019t talk to them. Leave us alone.\u201d\n\nFamily friend Kaley Katz worked to shut down the criticism, telling PEOPLE that the accusations of racism are \u201crumors\u201d and that it\u2019s not true that Keaton is the target of bullying because he used a racial slur.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkeaton-jones.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkeaton-jones2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkeaton-jones2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkeaton-jones2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Char Adams", "December"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/human-interest/backlash-tennessee-keaton-jones-bully-mom/", "title": "Keaton Jones: Backlash Has Brought More 'Bullies Out'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Kids,News", "news_keywords": "Kids,News", "description": "Keaton Jones hasn't returned to school since a video of him speaking out against bullying went viral", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Keaton Jones: Backlash Has Brought More 'Bullies Out'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/human-interest/backlash-tennessee-keaton-jones-bully-mom/", "description": "Keaton Jones hasn't returned to school since a video of him speaking out against bullying went viral", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkeaton-jones2.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/human-interest/backlash-tennessee-keaton-jones-bully-mom/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkeaton-jones2.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/human-interest/backlash-tennessee-keaton-jones-bully-mom/", "title": "Keaton Jones: Backlash Has Brought More 'Bullies Out'", "description": "Keaton Jones hasn't returned to school since a video of him speaking out against bullying went viral", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkeaton-jones2.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/human-interest/backlash-tennessee-keaton-jones-bully-mom/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
