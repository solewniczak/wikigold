He showed the royals the particular flowers \u2014 some of which were the princess\u2019s favorites, including white lilies \u2014 that had been cultivated to mark her life.\n\nBritain Princess Diana

were followed by white roses, lilies, gladioli, cosmos, gaura and fragrant nemesia that arrived in summer. \u201cAs we\u2019ve been working in the garden, many of our palace visitors have stopped to talk to us and share their own memories of Diana, Princess of Wales,\u201d Harkin said in April. \u201cWe hope that our garden captures the energy and spirit that made her such a popular figure around the world.\u201d\n\nBritain Princess Diana Credit: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP\n\nBritain Princess Diana Credit: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP\n\n_E8A2312 Credit: Courtesy Historical Royal Palaces\n\nThe palace
