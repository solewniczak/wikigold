And coming off the Women\u2019s March just a couple days prior, we were all kind of riding that high of female empowerment in the face of adversity.\n\nSo it was a bit of a letdown to hear Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s acceptance speech when he received his award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries for his role in Big Little Lies. Skarsg\u00e5rd plays Perry, an abusive husband in the HBO hit series, and in both his SAG Award acceptance speech and his acceptance speech for his Golden Globe he doesn\u2019t mention domestic abuse once. While we certainly don\u2019t place any of Perry\u2019s actions onto the actor, there is some cognitive dissonance in awarding a man for playing an abuser in a time when women are finally feeling emboldened enough to call out those who have abused them in real life, and then for that actor to completely ignore the subject of abuse when he\u2019s acknowledged for the role. You can watch his speech to see for yourself.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Skarsg\u00e5rd even manages to piss off veteran actor Robert DeNiro in the process, saying, \u201cA lot of people have been talking about who the greatest male actor ever is. Is it Mr. Robert DeNiro, or is it the tall guy from True Blood?\u201d DeNiro was nominated in the same category this year for his work in The Wizard of Lies, and while Skarsg\u00e5rd probably meant the comment to be a self-deprecating joke, DeNiro didn\u2019t seem to find the joke particularly funny.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1000&h=500&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F01%2F22%2FALE-e1516650008543.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F20%2Fsex-anxiety-tout.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F02%2F09%2FSwimsuits.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/misc/300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F17%2Fboob-sweat.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Fyuliya-kosolapova-bqirdOGHvYQ-unsplash-e1573767747444.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F07%2F08%2Fchiron-retrograde-2021.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F06%2F08%2Ffriendquestions-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fdream_about_ex.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F08%2FKendall-Ashley-e1515168536484-146x225-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1000&h=500&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F01%2F22%2FALE-e1516650008543.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kendall Ashley", "Updated Jan"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/awards-events/alexander-skarsgard-speech-sag-awards/", "title": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd gave another cringe-worthy speech at SAG Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Alexander Skarsg&aring;rd won a SAG Award last night, and once again chose to not speak out againt domestic violence in his acceptance speech.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Alexander Skarsg&aring;rd gave another cringe-worthy speech at SAG Awards", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/awards-events/alexander-skarsgard-speech-sag-awards/", "description": "Alexander Skarsg&aring;rd won a SAG Award last night, and once again chose to not speak out againt domestic violence in his acceptance speech.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1000&h=500&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F01%2F22%2FALE-e1516650008543.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 500}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/awards-events/alexander-skarsgard-speech-sag-awards/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F01%2F22%2FALE-e1516650008543.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/awards-events/alexander-skarsgard-speech-sag-awards/", "title": "Alexander Skarsg&aring;rd gave another cringe-worthy speech at SAG Awards", "description": "Alexander Skarsg&aring;rd won a SAG Award last night, and once again chose to not speak out againt domestic violence in his acceptance speech.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1000&h=500&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F01%2F22%2FALE-e1516650008543.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/awards-events/alexander-skarsgard-speech-sag-awards/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/pFQzqK3MrTc"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
