So I hope that also parallels the story that Bo has. He wants to do something great and important but in the end he realizes that the thing that\u2019s truly great is this thing that does not look glamorous.\"", "images": ["https://cdnph.upi.com/collection/fp/upi/11295/a3183b743426b2a074dcd50de481bde6/Gina-Rodriguez-and-Fifth-Harmony-attend-The-Star-premiere-in-LA_1_1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdnph.upi.com/collection/fp/upi/11295/a3183b743426b2a074dcd50de481bde6/Gina-Rodriguez-and-Fifth-Harmony-attend-The-Star-premiere-in-LA_1_1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Photos/Gina-Rodriguez-and-Fifth-Harmony-attend-The-Star-premiere-in-LA/11295/", "title": "In photos: Gina Rodriguez and Fifth Harmony attend 'The Star' premiere in LA", "meta_data": {"description": "The voice actors and soundtrack artists of the animated Christmas story &quot;The Star&quot; attend the premiere in Los Angeles on November 12.", "keywords": "news around the world, todays top headlines, top news stories, current news articles, United Press International , current world news, breaking news stories, latest world news, world news highlights, current events, latest headlines, top news, entertainment news, health news, science news, sports news, business news, daily news, latest news, todays news, top news, recent news, UPI, UPI.com", "news_keywords": "news around the world, todays top headlines, top news stories, current news articles, United Press International , current world news, breaking news stories, latest world news, world news highlights, current events, latest headlines, top news, entertainment news, health news, science news, sports news, business news, daily news, latest news, todays news, top news, recent news, UPI, UPI.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "The voice actors and soundtrack artists of the animated Christmas story &quot;The Star&quot; attend the premiere in Los Angeles on November 12.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Photos/Gina-Rodriguez-and-Fifth-Harmony-attend-The-Star-premiere-in-LA/11295/", "title": "Gina Rodriguez and Fifth Harmony attend 'The Star' premiere in LA  - Photos", "type": "album", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/collection/fp/upi/11295/a3183b743426b2a074dcd50de481bde6/Gina-Rodriguez-and-Fifth-Harmony-attend-The-Star-premiere-in-LA_1_1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.upi.com", "summary": ""}
