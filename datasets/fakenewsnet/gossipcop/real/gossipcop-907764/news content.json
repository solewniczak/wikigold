For the 2009\u20132012 original series, see Jersey Shore (TV series)\n\nJersey Shore: Family Vacation is an American reality television series that premiered globally, April 5, 2018 on MTV. The first season of the series follows seven housemates from the original Jersey Shore as they spend a month on vacation together in Miami, Florida.[1]\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nOn November 27, 2017, MTV announced that the cast (with the exception of Sammi Giancola) would be reuniting in Miami, Florida, for a new reunion season titled Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.[2] The series premiered globally in nearly 180 countries on April 5, 2018.[3] Most of production took place in Miami, with some additional filming in parts of New Jersey, Staten Island, and Las Vegas. This season also featured a trip to Resorts World Bimini, located in The Bahamas.\n\nOn February 28, 2018, a second season was ordered ahead of the series premiere. The second season premiered on August 23, 2018 and began with a vacation to Las Vegas.[4] The remainder of filming took place in various New Jersey locations including Seaside Heights, Atlantic City, Manalapan, and Point Pleasant. The second half of season two premiered on July 11, 2019 and focused around Sorrentino's court sentencing for tax evasion and his wedding. Filming locations included Stony Creek Ranch Resort in Stony Creek, NY and The Legacy Castle located in Pompton Plains, NJ.\n\nOn December 13, 2018, MTV renewed the series for a third season[5] and premiered on August 22, 2019.[6] The third season highlighted Mike going to prison, Ronnie going to rehab, Deena and Nicole's new babies, Jenni's divorce and new boyfriend, Angelina's wedding plans, and Vinny's Chippendales residency.[7] Filming took place in various locations including Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Point Pleasant, Holmdel, and Washington, D.C. The second half of season three premiered on February 27, 2020. It included the celebration of Angelina Pivarnick's bachelorette party and wedding, along with the return of Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino.[8][9] Filming took place in Manalapan, Asbury Park, New Orleans, and the Park Chateau Estate and Gardens in East Brunswick.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the series was renewed for a fourth season[10] and premiered on November 19, 2020.[11] The season begins with the aftermath of the infamous speech given by Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi, Jenni \"JWoww\" Farley, and Deena Nicole Cortese at Angelina Pivarnick's wedding. Since the wedding, Snooki decided to leave the show,[12] Jenni and Deena are still not on speaking terms with Angelina, Mike and Lauren are trying to get pregnant, and Pauly has a new girlfriend. All of this builds up to the whole world shutting down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The fourth season began filming with production in August 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The beginning of the season featured some self-shot footage and Zoom calls with the cast members. After months in quarantine, the cast and crew were back in production at the Hilton Lake Las Vegas Resort on September and October 2020. The entire resort was rented out in order to film within a quarantine bubble adhering to local, state and federal COVID-19 health and safety requirements during their stay.[13] The second half of season four premiered on June 3, 2021.[14] Filming took place at various locations in New Jersey, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles, as well as a vacation to the Woodloch Resort in the Pocono Mountains.[15] It was speculated for Snooki to be making a return to the show in some capacity, after she was spotted having lunch with Angelina in Florham Park, NJ.[16] This was officially confirmed on May 11, 2021 when MTV released the teaser for Season 4B featuring Snooki's return.[17] On April 22, 2021, Ortiz-Magro was arrested for domestic violence. At the time of his arrest, Ortiz-Magro was on probation as a result of his October 2019 domestic violence incident.[18] He was released shortly after on a $100,000 bond.[19] On May 13, 2021, Ortiz-Magro announced that he was stepping back from the show to focus on his mental health.[20]\n\nOn September 2, 2021, MTV renewed the series for a fifth season with Snooki returning as a main cast member.[21] The season premiered on January 6, 2022.[22]\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nMain [ edit ]\n\nRecurring [ edit ]\n\nCast member Seasons 1 2a 2b 3a 3b 4a 4b 5 Lauren Sorrentino Recurring Jen Harley Guest Recurring Guest Christopher Buckner Guest Recurring Guest Recurring Chris Larangeira Guest Recurring Guest Recurring Zack Carpinello Recurring Guest Recurring Nino Giaimo Guest Recurring Guest Recurring Guest Paola Giaimo Guest Recurring Guest Guest Nikki Hall Recurring Saffire Matos Recurring\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nSeries overview [ edit ]\n\nSeason Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired 1 14 April 5, 2018 ( ) June 28, 2018 ( 2018-06-28 ) 2 27 17 August 23, 2018 ( ) December 13, 2018 ( 2018-12-13 ) 10 July 11, 2019 ( ) August 15, 2019 ( 2019-08-15 ) 3 29 13 August 22, 2019 ( ) November 19, 2019 ( 2019-11-19 ) 16 February 27, 2020 ( ) June 18, 2020 ( 2020-06-18 ) 4 28 14 November 19, 2020 ( ) February 25, 2021 ( 2021-02-25 ) 14 June 3, 2021 ( ) September 2, 2021 ( 2021-09-02 ) 5 TBA January 6, 2022 ( ) TBA\n\nSeason 1 (2018) [ edit ]\n\nNo.\n\noverall No. in\n\nseason Title Original air date U.S. viewers\n\n(millions) 1 1 \"What's in the Bag?\" April 5, 2018 ( ) 2.42[23] 2 2 \"The Ring\" April 5, 2018 ( ) 2.56[23] 3 3 \"Sunday Vinday\" April 12, 2018 ( ) 1.68[24] 4 4 \"Ron Ron Juice\" April 19, 2018 ( ) 1.74[25] 5 5 \"About Last Night\" April 26, 2018 ( ) 1.45[26] 6 6 \"Meatball Down\" May 3, 2018 ( ) 1.51[27] 7 7 \"Baby Mama Drama\" May 10, 2018 ( ) 1.76[28] 8 8 \"The Temptation of the Keto Guido\" May 17, 2018 ( ) 1.70[29] 9 9 \"Umm, Hello\" May 24, 2018 ( ) 1.64[30] 10 10 \"Meatball Training Day\" May 31, 2018 ( ) 2.03[31] 11 11 \"Angelina Leaves Her Mark!\" June 7, 2018 ( ) 1.65[32] 12 12 \"JWoww vs. the Proposal\" June 14, 2018 ( ) 1.65[33] 13 13 \"Future Mrs. Situation?\" June 21, 2018 ( ) 1.66[34] 14 14 \"The Final Supper\" June 28, 2018 ( ) 1.64[35]\n\nSeason 2 (2018\u20132019) [ edit ]\n\nNo.\n\noverall No. in\n\nseason Title Original air date U.S. viewers\n\n(millions) 15 1 \"It\u2019s Complicated\" August 23, 2018 ( ) 1.36[36] 16 2 \"Oh Canada\" August 23, 2018 ( ) 1.36[36] 17 3 \"The Truth About Ronnie\" August 30, 2018 ( ) 1.34[37] 18 4 \"Heartbreak Hotel\" September 6, 2018 ( ) 1.43[38] 19 5 \"Frenemies\" September 13, 2018 ( ) 1.47[39] 20 6 \"The Designation\" September 20, 2018 ( ) 1.28[40] 21 7 \"Four Guidos and a Baby\" September 27, 2018 ( ) 1.22[41] 22 8 \"Back to Seaside\" October 4, 2018 ( ) 1.05[42] 23 9 \"Vinny and Angelina: A Love Story\" October 11, 2018 ( ) 1.15[43] 24 10 \"What a Drag\" October 18, 2018 ( ) 1.11[44] 25 11 \"Awkward City\" October 25, 2018 ( ) 1.25[45] 26 12 \"Where's the Beach?\" November 1, 2018 ( ) 1.26[46] 27 13 \"Staten Island Smackdown\" November 8, 2018 ( ) 1.28[47] 28 14 \"Jewish Barbie\" November 15, 2018 ( ) 1.21[48] 29 15 \"Pork Roll or Taylor Ham?\" November 29, 2018 ( ) 1.13[49] 30 16 \"Wallopin\u2019 in Manalapan\" December 6, 2018 ( ) 1.13[50] 31 17 \"Ronnie Magro\u2019s Series of Unfortunate Events\" December 13, 2018 ( ) 1.17[51] Part 2 32 18 \"The United States vs. The Situation (Part 1)\" July 11, 2019 ( ) 1.09[52] 33 19 \"The United States vs. The Situation (Part 2)\" July 11, 2019 ( ) 1.05[52] 34 20 \"Secaucus!\" July 18, 2019 ( ) 0.92[53] 35 21 \"The Dude Ranch\" July 18, 2019 ( ) 0.81[53] 36 22 \"Ranchelor Party\" July 25, 2019 ( ) 0.79[54] 37 23 \"Not Again\" August 1, 2019 ( ) 0.74[55] 38 24 \"Where's Ronnie?\" August 1, 2019 ( ) 0.73[55] 39 25 \"Tuxedo Time\" August 8, 2019 ( ) 0.66[56] 40 26 \"The Hitch-uation (Part 1)\" August 8, 2019 ( ) 0.70[56] 41 27 \"The Hitch-uation (Part 2)\" August 15, 2019 ( ) 1.01[57]\n\nSeason 3 (2019\u20132020) [ edit ]\n\nNo.\n\noverall No. in\n\nseason Title Original air date U.S. viewers\n\n(millions) 42 1 \"Goodbye Mike\" August 22, 2019 ( ) 0.94[58] 43 2 \"Thirty Days Later\" August 29, 2019 ( ) 0.87[59] 44 3 \"JWoww Gets Her Groove Back\" September 5, 2019 ( ) 0.82[60] 45 4 \"Gym, Tan, Strip\" September 12, 2019 ( ) 0.92[61] 46 5 \"Tick.
