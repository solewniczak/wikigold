It\u2019s 2018. Marijuana is finally allowed and sexual harassment finally isn\u2019t,\u201d quipped Globes host Seth Meyers in his opening remarks, bringing wild applause from the A-list audience in Beverly Hills.\n\nMultiple allegations against actors, filmmakers and Hollywood agents since October 2017 have led to many of the accused being fired, forced to step down, or dropped from creative projects.\n\nReferring to the male nominees gathered in Beverly Hills for the top television and movie awards, Meyers said: \u201cThis is the first time in three months it won\u2019t be terrifying to hear your name read out loud.\u201d\n\nThe evening began with the normally colourful red carpet transformed into a sea of black gowns as every actress showed solidarity with victims of sexual harassment inside and outside the entertainment industry.
