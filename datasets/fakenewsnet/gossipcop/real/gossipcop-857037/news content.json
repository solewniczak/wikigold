The Bad Liar songstress has recently become the proud homeowner of the gorgeous Studio City, Calif.abode, which she bought for a \u201cmodest\u2019 amount of $2.25 million.\n\nOf course, any property worth seven figures is not a bargain, but given the fact that Hollywood just adores massive mansions (also paired with massive price tags), Gomez scored quite a deal with her new mansion.\n\nThe newly remodeled pad rings in at 3,188 square feet, and it features four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and also two spacious walk-in closets with enough room for Selena\u2019s enormous and enviable wardrobe.\n\nGomez\u2019s new spread is all about the details, and this is because of the French doors, hardwood floors and the vaulted ceiling throughout each and every room.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget to mention the chart topper\u2019s multiple fireplaces, spa-like master baths and the extravagant kitchen with state-of-the-art amenities.\n\nSources: latina.com\n\nHer brick-lined backyard sports a gorgeous swimming pool and spa and also an entertaining pavilion.\n\nIt also boasts fruit trees, veggie beds, and a grape arbor. It seems that Selena picked up a passion for gardening, what else can we say?\n\nGomez and her boyfriend The Weeknd have been on the very same page as of late since the hip-hop superstar has recently dropped over $20 million on a Hidden Hills estate himself.\n\nAbel\u2019s property is 13,391 square feet, and the outdoor area is something to marvel.\n\nHe has also a 1,200 square-foot guest house and a beautiful backyard with a pool and everything, but he also has an 8-stall barn and pasture areas in his new digs.\n\nHe has great neighbors including Drake and the Kardashians who also live in the exclusive gated community so what more could he possibly desire?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe will be able to enjoy his new home when his tour ends. While SelGo and the Weeknd still have time to move in together, but for now they have double the property to allow their romance to grow and flourish.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Bernice-Burgos-T.I.-Tameka-Tiny-Cottle-300x190.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/According-To-The-Hollywood-Standards-Selena-Gomezs-New-Los-Angeles-Home-Is-Totally-Affordable.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Selena-Gomez-1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Rob-Kardashian-Blac-Chyna-Tyga-Back-Together-300x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kylie-jenner-1-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tyra-banks-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Kanye-West-Kim-Kardashian-Wedding-Anniversary-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Tiny-Divorce-T.I.-Distraction-300x179.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ben-Stiller-and-Christine-Taylor-300x160.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brad-pitt-chris-cornell-300x222.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Rob-Kardashian-Blac-Chyna-Tyga-Back-Together-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Bernice-Burgos-And-Tameka-Tiny-Cottle-300x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/According-To-The-Hollywood-Standards-Selena-Gomezs-New-Los-Angeles-Home-Is-Totally-Affordable.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832/http://celebrityinsider.org/according-to-the-hollywood-standards-selena-gomezs-new-los-angeles-home-is-totally-affordable-40285/", "title": "According To The Hollywood Standards, Selena Gomez\u2019s New Los Angeles Home Is Totally Affordable", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Brandon Fitch", "news_keywords": "drake, selena gomez, the kardashians, the weeknd,", "keywords": "celebrity news, drake, selena gomez, the kardashians, the weeknd,", "description": "Selena Gomes is not at all strapped for money, but her newest purchase is quite responsible financially speaking. \u00a0The Bad Liar songstress has", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "According To The Hollywood Standards, Selena Gomez\u2019s New Los Angeles Home Is Totally Affordable", "description": "Selena Gomes is not at all strapped for money, but her newest purchase is quite responsible financially speaking. \u00a0The Bad Liar songstress has", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832/http://celebrityinsider.org/according-to-the-hollywood-standards-selena-gomezs-new-los-angeles-home-is-totally-affordable-40285/", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131832im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/According-To-The-Hollywood-Standards-Selena-Gomezs-New-Los-Angeles-Home-Is-Totally-Affordable.jpg", "site_name": "Celebrity News, Gossip -
