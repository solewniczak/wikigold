While the episode, titled \"The Wedding,\" will feature some upbeat moments as Kate Pearson (Chrissy Metz) gets ready to marry her longtime love Toby (Chris Sullivan), emotions will run high as she walks down the aisle without her dearly departed dad (Milo Ventimiglia) by her side.\n\nBut now, promos for \"The Wedding\" episode confirm that Jack will be back for his little girl's big day. The teaser for the This Is Us season 2 finale shows Jack Pearson in the present day, sporting gray hair, a salt-and-pepper goatee, and wire-rimmed glasses as he touches his wife Rebecca's (Mandy Moore) face and says, \"Where'd the time go, Bec?\"\n\nThis Is Us fans (and pretty much the rest of the universe) know that Jack Pearson died on Super Bowl Sunday in 1998 when he was 53 years old. The Pearson patriarch saved the family dog (and a pillowcase full of family belongings!) after a house fire, but he couldn't save himself. Complications from smoke inhalation did Papa Pearson in, and now Kate's wedding marks 20 years since his tragic passing.\n\nThe trailer for \"The Wedding\" features a flashback of a younger Jack telling 10-year-old Kate (Mackenzie Hancsicsak): \"The guy that gets to marry you, Katey girl, he is one lucky guy.\" Later, we see adult Kate flanked by her brothers Kevin and Randall (Justin Hartley, Sterling K. Brown) as she walks down the aisle. The promo teases a \"special guest\" at Kate and Toby's wedding and that's when old man Jack is seen.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8881934fec783f32aef96d94ac2f65be?s=800", "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/7d29454b-301e-4088-86fa-3aff1cf25b9e.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/4SgB8SqjF2WtcNFudGrr.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nicole-scherzinger-2.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mandy-Rose-3.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4816599/this-is-us-see-milo-ventimiglia-play-jack-pearson-as-an-old-man-in-season-2-finale/", "title": "'This Is Us': See Milo Ventimiglia Play Jack Pearson As An Old Man In Season 2 Finale", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'This Is Us': See Milo Ventimiglia Play Jack Pearson As An Old Man In Season 2 Finale", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4816599/this-is-us-see-milo-ventimiglia-play-jack-pearson-as-an-old-man-in-season-2-finale/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "'This Is Us': See Milo Ventimiglia Play Jack Pearson As An Old Man In Season 2 Finale", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-03-07 06:54:54Z", "section": "Television"}, "description": "'This Is Us': See Milo Ventimiglia Play Jack Pearson As An Old Man In Season 2 Finale", "keywords": "Television", "news_keywords": "Television", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520405694.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
