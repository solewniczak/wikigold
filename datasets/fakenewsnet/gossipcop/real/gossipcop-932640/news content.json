I just think that it\u2019s really important for me to be there for them, and even though I want to go away and travel and do things for myself, it\u2019s hard to find the balance of allowing myself to do that and not feel guilty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely learned from my past relationship, where I really wouldn\u2019t travel without the kids and I think it is important to take time \u2014 especially because my relationship is important to me and those worlds aren\u2019t colliding right now \u2014 just making sure that I make time for both,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think going on a trip once in a while reminds me the importance of being present and in the moment when I\u2019m at home, and I think it makes me the best mom that I can be.\u201d\n\nHaider Ackermann :
