This Is How They Roll #Easter,\" she captioned the snapshot.\n\nCiara and Wilson, a quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks, married in July 2016. The singer discussed her family in an interview with E! News in March, saying it has been \"so fun\" but \"different\" to raise a daughter after having a son.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think it's inevitable for her to have a little bit of tomboy in her from Future, Russ and me,\" she said. \"She's going to have some of that edge to her.\"\n\nCiara also shared plans for her seventh studio album. She last released the album Jackie in May 2015.\n\n\"Two months before I gave birth to [Sienna] I started making the record,\" the star said. \"I'm not gonna rush the process but I'm super excited. I'm really thrilled to put the music out for my fans when it's time.\"", "images": ["https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/8491522767589/2018/1/2b03f42bfd428fd8977e9656d437bd73/v1.5/Ciara-posts-photos-from-first-Easter-with-daughter-Sienna.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/upi/8491522767589/2018/1/2b03f42bfd428fd8977e9656d437bd73/Ciara-posts-photos-from-first-Easter-with-daughter-Sienna.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/8491522767589/2018/1/2b03f42bfd428fd8977e9656d437bd73/v1.5/Ciara-posts-photos-from-first-Easter-with-daughter-Sienna.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Annie Martin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2018/04/03/Ciara-posts-photos-from-first-Easter-with-daughter-Sienna/8491522767589/", "title": "Ciara posts photos from first Easter with daughter Sienna", "meta_data": {"description": "Ciara shared pictures from her family Easter celebration with Russell Wilson, son Future Zahir and daughter Sienna Princess.", "keywords": "Entertainment, Ciara, Russell Wilson", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Ciara, Russell Wilson", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Ciara shared pictures from her family Easter celebration with Russell Wilson, son Future Zahir and daughter Sienna Princess.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2018/04/03/Ciara-posts-photos-from-first-Easter-with-daughter-Sienna/8491522767589/", "title": "Ciara posts photos from first Easter with daughter Sienna", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/8491522767589/2018/1/2b03f42bfd428fd8977e9656d437bd73/v1.5/Ciara-posts-photos-from-first-Easter-with-daughter-Sienna.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 463}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPI", "title": "Ciara posts photos from first Easter with daughter Sienna", "description": "Ciara shared pictures from her family Easter celebration with Russell Wilson, son Future Zahir and daughter Sienna Princess.", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8491522767589/2018/upi/2b03f42bfd428fd8977e9656d437bd73/v2.1/Ciara-posts-photos-from-first-Easter-with-daughter-Sienna.jpg?lg=4"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.upi.com", "summary": ""}
