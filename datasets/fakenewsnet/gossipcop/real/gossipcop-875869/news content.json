Five months later, the duo announced their split, saying in a statement, \u201cWe gave this relationship our all and we are saddened that we did not get the fairytale ending we hoped for.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nNow, the 29-year-old is opening up about why things didn\u2019t work out and how she plans on moving forward.\n\n\u201cMy relationship with Nick and experience on The Bachelor has given me so many amazing and memorable moments in my life, and I am forever grateful,\u201d Grimaldi exclusively tells PEOPLE in this week\u2019s issue. \u201cNick and I were always transparent about the challenges in a relationship. We certainly had ours. I fell for him hard, and when you fall in love that hard, your heart breaks even harder.\u201d\n\n2017 MTV Movie And TV Awards - Arrivals Credit: David Crotty/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images\n\n\u201cIn the end, as much as we loved each other and tried to make it work, we just realized we were different people fighting to keep a relationship when ultimately we just weren\u2019t\u2019 the best fit for each other,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the distance that was ever an issue. Both Nick and I decided together, with our families\u2019 support, that I would put my teaching career on hold and uproot my life to Los Angeles to support him on Dancing with the Stars and build a life together.\u201d\n\nF:PHOTOMediaFactory ActionsRequests DropBox48061#MARLON KUHNREICHMRLN1734.jpg Credit: MARLON KUHNREICH\n\nOf the emotional Instagram she posted last week, Grimaldi tells PEOPLE, \u201cI wanted to share that message with the world. Whatever hardships people are going through, don\u2019t be embarrassed of feeling no feelings \u2013 if it\u2019s anger, hurt, sadness \u2013 just remember at the end of the day to remain optimistic, because you will come out of it, and you\u2019ll come out it a stronger person. It always will be okay in the end.\u201d\n\nViall appeared on two previous seasons of The Bachelorette and season 3 of Bachelor in Paradise before taking his turn as the lead suitor.\n\nEven before getting engaged, L.A.-based Viall and Canadian Grimaldi struggled to decide where they would continue their relationship.\n\nViall is handling the split \u201cokay,\u201d a source previously told PEOPLE. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an overnight decision, and they\u2019re amicable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one set way to get over heartbreak,\u201d Grimaldi says now. \u201cWhen going through any hardship, it\u2019s okay to take the time to grieve the loss of what could have been. It\u2019s okay to cry and curl up under your covers for as long as you need. I\u2019m not ashamed to say that I\u2019ve done all of those things, but with my family\u2019s and close friend\u2019s support \u2013 it\u2019s all really helped the process for me.\u201d\n\nvanessa-grimaldi Credit: MARLON KUHNREICH\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to look forward now and remain positive,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes, breakups aren\u2019t easy, letting go of the idea of what could\u2019ve been isn\u2019t easy, either, but I\u2019m trying to stay optimistic about the future and that one day the person that I\u2019m meant to be with and start a family with \u2014 when the timing is right \u2014 we will find our way to each other.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Grimaldi came out of this a stronger person and wants nothing but the best for Viall.",
