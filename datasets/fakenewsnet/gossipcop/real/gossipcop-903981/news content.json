He also explains why they dated other people when they first started seeing each other. (We were \u201ckeeping ourselves safe from getting hurt,\u201d he writes.)\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cWhen I met Jess, it was undeniable how beautiful she is,\u201d Timberlake, 37, writes in Hindsight, out Tuesday. He and The Sinner actress, now 36, met at a party in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cI made some sort of sarcastic comment, really dry,\u201d he explains. \u201cNobody got it except her. She laughed, and I noticed, all of a sudden, and in the way where you wonder if a person\u2019s like you, if they have a very dry, dark sense of humor, too.\u201d\n\njustin-timberlake-hindsight-1 Credit: \"Hindsight\" by Justin Timberlake/Harper Design\n\nThough he didn\u2019t ask for her number that night, he kept thinking: \u201cI\u2019m kind of really interested in that girl. There was just something about that girl. Kind of interested in that girl. Goddamn it.\u201d\n\nHe writes, \u201cI had to psych myself up. I had to remind myself that I was me \u2014 giving myself a pep talk, shadowboxing with myself, rubbing my own shoulders.\u201d\n\nAmerican Express x Justin Timberlake \"Man Of The Woods\" Listening Session at Clarkson Square Credit: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for American Express\n\nThey saw each other again when she came to a show during his FutureSex/LoveSounds tour. He offered her and her friends a ride on his tour bus, which is when he finally asked for her number and they started talking, according to the book.\n\nJustin Timberlake Reveals He Weighs in on Jessica Biel\u2019s Footwear Purchases: \u2018I Love Women\u2019s Shoes\u2019\n\n\u201cThen the Golden Globes came up, and that\u2019s when we planned on seeing each other,\u201d Timberlake writes. \u201cWe were both still seeing other people, keeping ourselves safe from getting hurt, from really putting ourselves out there. It took a bit for both of us to admit to ourselves that we were really, really into each other.\u201d\n\nAfter he came back from touring abroad they spent a month together. Then they decided to be exclusive, according to Hindsight.\n\njustin-timberlake-hindsight-3 Credit: \"Hindsight\" by Justin Timberlake/Harper Design\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of unforgettable times,\u201d Timberlake writes. \u201cShe\u2019s become a huge influence on my life, and I have such an admiration for her, especially seeing her as a mother now.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cBut I had admiration for her before. She\u2019s a very good writer. She\u2019s a poet. She\u2019s a tremendous actor. She\u2019s funny. Very funny. And she\u2019s one of the most patient people I\u2019ve ever met\u2026 She changed me. She changed my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as simple as having someone there to open that pickle jar when you can\u2019t get it open and as complicated as deciding to be in each other\u2019s lives forever,\u201d Biel told PEOPLE in a 2012 interview about marrying Timberlake. \u201cThat kind of commitment is very special, and we were ready to jump.\u201d\n\nNBC's \"70th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards\" - Backstage Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel | Credit: Todd Williamson/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty\n\nIn April 2015, the couple welcomed son Silas Randall. According to Timberlake, parenthood has deepened his connection with his wife and influenced his songwriting. (Timberlake writes that his wife, son, and grandfather inspired his latest album, Man of the Woods.)\n\nbiel-timberlake The couple with their 3\u00bd-year-old son Silas Randall | Credit: Jessica Biel/Instagram\n\nDuring an interview on the Today show this past August, Biel reflected on her marriage with Timberlake. According to Biel, the key to a strong marriage is hard work, and the need for commitment never goes away.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky enough to go and stay in different places and live in different places while we work and that\u2019s definitely part [of having a strong marriage],\u201d Biel told Savannah Guthrie, referring to her time traveling the world with Timberlake while on his tour.\n\njustin-timberlake-hindsight-2 Silas and Justin Timberlake | Credit: \"Hindsight\" by Justin Timberlake/Harper Design\n\n\u201cBut, honestly, I just really feel like you have to work hard,\u201d Biel shared. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t change if you work at home or in an office or you\u2019re on a tour. It doesn\u2019t change, the work doesn\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nTimberlake presented some of his own reflections about their 10 years as a couple in Hindsight. Timberlake writes that, rather than wanting to \u201cbe loved for what we are,\u201d the bigger desire is \u201cto be loved for what we aren\u2019t. I think we want to be loved for all our f\u2014ed-up s\u2014.\u201d\n\njustin-timberlake-hindsight-6 Credit: \"Hindsight\" by Justin Timberlake/Harper Design\n\n\u201cWe should say \u2018I will\u2019 instead of \u2018I do\u2019 when we get married because people constantly change, both physically and mentally. I\u2019ve watched my wife change,\u201d he writes. \u201cI\u2019ve watched her body change. It\u2019s a temple. It should be worshipped. It should be marveled at. I\u2019m fascinated by her. She\u2019s everything, man.\u201d\n\nHe continues, \u201cShe just constantly surprises me with who she is, and who she\u2019s becoming, and I really hope I do the same for her. I\u2019m excited to see what she\u2019s going to do next. I wake up and roll over and look at her, and I\u2019m inspired.\u201d", "images":
