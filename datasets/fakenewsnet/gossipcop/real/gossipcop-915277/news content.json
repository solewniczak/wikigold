But her health and well-being must be put before all else,\u201d a show rep tells PEOPLE. \u201cWendy has been openly dealing with her Graves\u2019 Disease for many years in addition to hyperthyroidism. Yesterday, Wendy\u2019s doctor prescribed a necessary three weeks of rest to get her levels and medication in sync. The show will be in repeats during this unplanned hiatus. A live show was produced today so that Wendy could speak directly to her fans and explain her condition.\u201d\n\nAfter canceling an appointment with her endocrinologist scheduled for December in favor of a business meeting, Williams finally saw the doctor on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMy doctor has prescribed \u2014 are you ready? \u2014 as of today, three weeks of vacation,\u201d she announced. \u201cWhat? Who are you? I was pissed.\u201d\n\nThe TV personality joked, \u201cI\u2019ll be back in two. I\u2019m not an heiress \u2014 who is going to pay my bills? Are you serious? I\u2019m just saying, I come from working class.\u201d\n\nWilliams also had an important message to women to put their health first.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to say to women, more than men, is stop putting everyone first because if we\u2019re not good, they\u2019re not good,\u201d she said.\n\nThe announcement comes after Williams canceled several shows last week because she was experiencing \u201cflu-ish\u201d symptoms, she said in an Instagram post last Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI do go to the doctors today to find out what exactly it is,\u201d she explained. \u201cI feel awful. I had to be talked out of going to work today and taking off a few days to get myself together.\u201d\n\nThe talk show host also fainted during a live broadcast of her show on Halloween, which she attributed to feeling \u201coverheated\u201d in her elaborate Statue of Liberty costume. The broadcast quickly cut to commercial, and Williams continued the show when they returned.\n\nThe day after the incident, Williams recounted the collapse to her studio audience.\n\n\u201cIt was scary,\u201d she recalled, choking up. \u201cIt was really scary. It was so scary, all I could think of in the middle of the scare was, \u2018Don\u2019t pull the podium over on you, because that\u2019ll make it worse.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter closing out the show, paramedics informed her she was low on electrolytes.\n\n\u201cMy blood pressure was fine, my heart rate was fine, everything was fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a 53-year-old middle-aged woman going through what middle-aged women go through, if you know what I mean. The costume got hot. Right before passing out, I felt like I was in the middle of a campfire.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fwendy-williams-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fwendy-williams-1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fwendy-williams-1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit", "February"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/wendy-williams-graves-disease/", "title": "Wendy Williams Suffers from Thyroid Issues & Graves' Disease, Will Take 3-Week Hiatus", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "News,Wendy Williams", "news_keywords": "News,Wendy Williams", "description": "Wendy Williams\u00a0is taking time off from her self-titled show to focus on her\u00a0hyperthyroidism and\u00a0Graves' disease", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Wendy Williams Suffers from Thyroid Issues & Graves' Disease, Will Take 3-Week Hiatus", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/wendy-williams-graves-disease/", "description": "Wendy Williams\u00a0is taking time off from her self-titled show to focus on her\u00a0hyperthyroidism and\u00a0Graves' disease", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fwendy-williams-1-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/wendy-williams-graves-disease/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fwendy-williams-1-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/wendy-williams-graves-disease/", "title": "Wendy Williams Suffers from Thyroid Issues & Graves' Disease, Will Take 3-Week Hiatus", "description": "Wendy Williams\u00a0is taking time off from her self-titled show to focus on her\u00a0hyperthyroidism and\u00a0Graves' disease", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fwendy-williams-1-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/wendy-williams-graves-disease/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
