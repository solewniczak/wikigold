The low back feature on the dress was at the request of Eugenie, who had surgery at 12 years old to correct her scoliosis.\n\nPrincess Eugenie wedding Credit: Press Association via AP Images\n\n\u201cI think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think it\u2019s really special to stand up for that,\u201d she told the U.K.\u2019s This Morning.\n\nPilotto and De Vos worked with Eugenie to research previous dresses worn by members of the royal family to identify the right silhouette for her wedding.\n\nThe wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank, Pre-Ceremony, Windsor, Berkshire, UK - 12 Oct 2018 Credit: James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe fabric of her gown features a number of motifs that hold particularly special meaning to Eugenie. The symbols include a thistle for Scotland, to acknowledge her and Jack\u2019s fondness for Balmoral, a shamrock for Ireland as a reflection of her maternal family, the York rose and ivy to represent the couple\u2019s home.\n\nThe only bit of information she revealed before her big day was that she wanted to pick a designer from her home country. \u201c[The dress] is the one thing that I was really decisive about,\u201d she told British Vogue. \u201cAs soon as we announced the wedding, I knew the designer, and the look, straight away. I never thought I\u2019d be the one who knew exactly what I like, but I\u2019ve been pretty on top of it.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Celebrity Guests Arrive at Princess Eugenie\u2019s Wedding\n\nUnlike Kate and Meghan, however, Princes Eugenie chose not to wear a veil.\n\nFor Kate\u2019s 2011 wedding to Prince William, she stuck with a British-based designer too, wearing a custom Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen lace long-sleeve, V-neck gown.\n\nkate-pippa-3-2000 Kate Middleton on her wedding day | Credit: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nBut it was Meghan\u2019s long-sleeved, unembellished gown that switched-up the British designer trend. U.K. designer Clare Waight Keller designed her custom creation, but for the brand, Givenchy, which is a French fashion house.\n\nThe wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Ceremony, St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, Berkshire, UK - 19 May 2018 Credit: Meghan Markle\n\nAll three royals opted for long-sleeves and more modest designs, then went with sexier more revealing designs for the reception.\n\nmeghan-kate-split Credit: STEVE PARSONS/AFP/Getty Images; John Stillwell - WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nMeghan wore a custom silk Stella McCartney evening dress in \u201clily white\u201d featuring a high halter neck and sexy open back, while Kate changed into a white satin strapless evening gown with shrug for her reception.\n\nPrincess Eugenie wore the Greville Emerald Kokoshnik Tiara, lent to her by the Queen. The tiara is made of brilliant and rose cut diamonds pav\u00e9 set in platinum, with six emeralds on either side and was bequeathed by Mrs. Greville to Queen Elizabeth in 1942.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fprincess-eugenie-8-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F02%2Fprincess-eugenie-6-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1024&h=512&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fkate-eugenie-meghan.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fmeghan-kate-split.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fdress-tout.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fprincess-eugenie-1-20001.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fkate-eugenie-meghan.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fprincess-eugenie-1-2000-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F01%2Fkate-pippa-3-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1024&h=512&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fkate-eugenie-meghan.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colleen Kratofil", "Kaitlyn Frey", "October"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/royals/princess-eugenie-royal-wedding-dress-compared-to-kate-middleton-meghan-markle/", "title": "Princess Eugenie's Wedding Dress Compared to Kate and Meghan's", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Jack Brooksbank,Kate Middleton,Meghan Markle,Princess Eugenie,Royal Style,Royal Wedding,Wedding Dresses,Wedding Style,Weddings", "news_keywords": "Jack Brooksbank,Kate Middleton,Meghan Markle,Princess Eugenie,Royal Style,Royal Wedding,Wedding Dresses,Wedding Style,Weddings", "description": "All the similarities (and major differences!) between Princess Eugenie's wedding gown compared to Kate Middleton's and Meghan Markle's", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Royal Brides!
