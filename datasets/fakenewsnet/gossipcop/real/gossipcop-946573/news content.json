The star-studded celebration \u2014 which includes many Game of Thrones stars as guests \u2014 is set to continue at the bride\u2019s family\u2019s castle.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nWhile walking down the aisle, Leslie, 31, looked radiant in an delicate long-sleeve lacy dress. The actress wore a floral garland on her head as well as a white veil, which appeared to extend all the way from the top of her head to the hem of her gown.\n\nLeslie also carried a small bouquet of flowers.\n\nkit-d Rose Leslie and Kit Harington | Credit: SplashNews.com\n\nrose Rose Leslie | Credit: SplashNews.com\n\nThe groom also was dressed formally for the occasion, wearing a black jacket, a cream-colored vest and a pair of striped pants.\n\nkit-harington-b Kit Harington | Credit: Jane Barlow/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nThe pair\u2019s special day was also attended by plenty of Harington and Leslie\u2019s GoT costars. Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams \u2014 who play sisters on the beloved HBO drama \u2014 were seen arriving at the venue together on Saturday.\n\nTurner, who is engaged to singer Joe Jonas, wore a red suit dress with a pair of over-the-knee length black boots to the ceremony, which she accessorized with a pair of red sunglasses and a black-and-white checkered purse.\n\nWilliams, 21, opted for a more low-key look and wore a black jumpsuit with a pair of red heels.\n\nAhead of the ceremony, Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke were also seen arriving in Aberdeen, Scotland, on Friday. Dinklage has picked up two Emmy Awards and one Golden Globe for his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister, while Clarke plays Daenerys Targaryen (Harington\u2019s current love interest and, ahem, long-lost aunt on the show).\n\nsophie-turner Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams | Credit: SplashNews.com\n\nFollowing the ceremony, the newly-joined husband and wife and their guests will gather for a reception at nearby Wardhill Castle.\n\nThe couple got engaged in September 2017, confirming the happy news the old-fashioned (and very British) way: through a classified advert in The Times.\n\nIn October, though, the actor admitted to botching his proposal a bit during an appearance on the U.K.\u2019s Jonathan Ross Show.\n\n\u201cI did have some plans to do it, I was going to string up some lights in some trees and do all the romantic stuff, but we were in the country and we were under this beautiful night sky and had a log fire burning and red wine and I blew my load early,\u201d he said before laughing at the sexual insinuation. \u201cSorry, that\u2019s a really bad expression!\u201d\n\nThe actors first stirred up relationship rumors in 2012, in sync with their fictional GoT counterparts, Jon Snow and Ygritte.\n\nThe Olivier Awards With Mastercard - Red Carpet Arrivals Rose Leslie and Kit Harington\n\nAfter a brief split, the couple reconciled and continued to fuel romance speculation until they officially confirmed the relationship in April 2016. They made their red carpet debut as a couple at the Olivier Awards in London.\n\nThey became close while on set in Iceland shooting for season 2. Harington previously opened up about the early days of their romance, admitting that those weeks were his favorite of the series.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fkit-harington-b-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1333&h=667&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fkit-d-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fsophie-turner.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fkit-d-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F08%2Fgettyimages-518893152-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Frose.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1333&h=667&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fkit-d-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michele Corriston", "Maria Pasquini", "Phil Boucher", "June"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kit-harington-rose-leslie-married-wedding-photos/", "title": "Kit Harington Marries Rose Leslie in Romantic Scotland Ceremony \u2014 See the Photos!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Couples,Game of Thrones,Kit Harington,News,Rose Leslie,Weddings", "news_keywords": "Couples,Game of Thrones,Kit Harington,News,Rose Leslie,Weddings", "description": "Kit Harington and Rose Leslie met on the set of Game of Thrones", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Kit Harington Marries Rose Leslie in Romantic Scotland Ceremony &mdash; See the Photos!", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kit-harington-rose-leslie-married-wedding-photos/", "description": "Kit Harington and Rose Leslie met on the set of Game of Thrones", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1333&h=667&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fkit-d-1.jpg", "width": 1333, "height": 667}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/kit-harington-rose-leslie-married-wedding-photos/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fkit-d-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kit-harington-rose-leslie-married-wedding-photos/", "title": "Kit Harington Marries Rose Leslie in Romantic Scotland Ceremony &mdash; See the Photos!", "description": "Kit Harington and Rose Leslie met on the set of Game of Thrones", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1333&h=667&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Fkit-d-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/kit-harington-rose-leslie-married-wedding-photos/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
