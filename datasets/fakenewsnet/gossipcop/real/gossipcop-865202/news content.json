Harry had earlier this year admitted to undergoing counseling to cope with the loss of mother Princess Diana.", "images": ["https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-1014220954-768x512.jpg", "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Red-carpet-beauty-from-2022-Baftas-and-Critics-Choice-768x384.jpg", "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MiNDFOOD-copy.jpg", "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/harry-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/footer-banner-2.png", "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AtongAtem_01-768x1152.jpg", "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MiNDFOOD_white.png", "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/harry.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/harry.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carmarlena Murdaca"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mindfood.com/article/prince-harry-there-is-much-much-more-that-we-can-do-to-promote-mental-health-awareness/", "title": "Prince Harry: \u2018There Is Much More We Can Do\u2019 To Promote Mental Health Awareness", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Prince Harry: 'There Is Much More We Can Do' To Promote Mental Health Awareness | MiNDFOOD", "description": "According to Prince Harry, more people should take a break from checking their mobile phones to \"process their thoughts\" instead of rushing through their day.", "url": "https://www.mindfood.com/article/prince-harry-there-is-much-much-more-that-we-can-do-to-promote-mental-health-awareness/", "site_name": "MiNDFOOD", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/harry.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/harry.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 683}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mindfoodmag/", "section": "News 24/7"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "According to Prince Harry, more people should take a break from checking their mobile phones to \"process their thoughts\" instead of rushing through their day.", "title": "Prince Harry: 'There Is Much More We Can Do' To Promote Mental Health Awareness | MiNDFOOD", "site": "@mindfood_mag", "image": "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/harry.jpg", "creator": "@mindfood_mag"}, "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.70.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/favicon.gif"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.mindfood.com", "summary": ""}
