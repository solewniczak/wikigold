But with much of their attention focused on the finale, Jimmy Kimmel swooped in as an avenging angel to turn the tables on their costar.\n\nWith help from Scandal actor Katie Lowes, Kimmel set the stage for a grand prank. Malina was expecting to surprise an unsuspecting family watching the show together at home, but when he fired off a small confetti canon in their living room, the actor pretending to be the grandmother faked a heart problem.\n\nMalina began to panic as Lowes came to her aid and the producers called an ambulance. Meanwhile, Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes and the rest of the series cast cracked up watching pre-recorded footage of the prank from the Jimmy Kimmel Live stage on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to scare you. I\u2019m so sorry. We\u2019re here for you. Breathe,\u201d Malina said as he grabbed the fake grandma\u2019s hand and she started to cry.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Kimmel emerged as an EMT that Malina realized this whole thing was staged. \u201cThat is the worst thing anyone has ever done to me,\u201d the actor laughed.\n\nMalina did get one more surprise as he left to face Kimmel\u2019s cameras, and that was a firefighter spraying him with a hose.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t have it coming,\u201d he said.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F04%2F09%2Fnick-romano-image.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fmalina-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-691304392-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fmalina-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Romano", "April", "At Am Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/20/jimmy-kimmel-scandal-prank-josh-malina/", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel gets revenge for Scandal cast by pranking Josh Malina", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Jimmy Kimmel,Josh Malina,Last Night on Late Night", "news_keywords": "Jimmy Kimmel,Josh Malina,Last Night on Late Night", "description": "He had it coming", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Jimmy Kimmel gets revenge for 'Scandal' cast by pranking Josh Malina", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/20/jimmy-kimmel-scandal-prank-josh-malina/", "description": "He had it coming", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fmalina-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/20/jimmy-kimmel-scandal-prank-josh-malina/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fmalina-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/20/jimmy-kimmel-scandal-prank-josh-malina/", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel gets revenge for 'Scandal' cast by pranking Josh Malina", "description": "He had it coming", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fmalina-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/20/jimmy-kimmel-scandal-prank-josh-malina/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/9XaUPRA6ZAI"], "publish_date": 1524175200.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
