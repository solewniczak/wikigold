Alastair Grant/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nDuring Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank\u2019s wedding on Friday, Kate Middleton placed her hand on Prince William\u2018s thigh, and the duke rested his hand on top of hers.\n\nThere\u2019s no official protocol that forbids royal couples from holding hands in public.\n\nBut there is a royal precedent, set by Queen Elizabeth II, that discourages PDA, especially during official engagements.\n\nWhile Prince Harry and Meghan Markle frequently engage in PDA, William and Middleton rarely do the same.\n\nWilliam, who is second in line for the throne, may be held to stricter standards than royals who will likely never become the monarch.\n\nDuring Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank\u2019s wedding, Prince William and Kate Middleton melted people\u2019s hearts with a brief public display of affection.\n\nFriday morning, eagle-eyed royal fans spotted the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge sharing a tender moment while sitting in St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle. At one point of the nuptial ceremony, Middleton placed her hand on her husband\u2019s thigh, at which point the duke then rested his hand on top of hers \u2013 as seen in the post below by the fan account Kate Middleton Style.\n\nThe couple were all smiles in St. George\u2019s Chapel.

According to Meier, the founder of Beaumont Etiquette, it all comes down to each couple\u2019s \u201cpersonal preference.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely up to each couple to do what they feel most comfortable,\u201d Meier said.\n\nHowever, since Queen Elizabeth II is rarely affectionate with Prince Philip in public, the monarch seems to have set \u201can unwritten precedent\u201d that discourages PDA \u2013 especially during official royal engagements, as body language expert Robin Kermode previously told the Daily Mail.\n\n\u201cIt is rare to see royal couples holding hands on official outings,\u201d Meier told People. \u201cA more serious engagement would warrant a more serious level of professionalism, which each royal is sure to follow.\u201d\n\nThat may be one reason why Prince William and Kate Middleton are rarely seen holding hands or engaging in PDA.\n\nThe duchess and duke often stand in this stoic pose. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nNot to mention, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who married in 2011, have been working royals for a while.\n\nAs INSIDER\u2019s Kristin Salaky previously noted, William is second in line for the throne, behind only his father, Prince Charles. As such, the duke may be held to stricter standards in his role as a royal.\n\nIn comparison, Prince Harry \u2013 who is sixth in line for the throne and therefore much less likely to become the British monarch in his lifetime \u2013 frequently holds hands with his wife, Meghan Markle, in public.\n\nRead more: Why Prince William and Kate Middleton never hold hands but Prince Harry and Meghan Markle do\n\nSince the two married in May, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have made headlines time and time again for their sweet public displays of affection.\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry held hands during an official visit to the Joff Youth Center on October 3. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nOf course, it\u2019s just as likely that Prince William and Middleton simply prefer not to hold hands in public or to save such displays of affection for special occasions.\n\nVisit INSIDER\u2019s homepage for more.", "images": ["https://www.businessinsider.com.au/wp-content/themes/businessinsider-2021/assets/src/images/pg-logo-small.png", "https://imgix.businessinsider.com.au/content/uploads/sites/5/2022/01/25/iStock-1297291300-e1643078854958.jpeg?ar=4%3A3&auto=format&fit=max&q=65&w=256", "https://imgix.businessinsider.com.au/content/uploads/sites/5/2022/03/16/susan-ley.jpg?ar=4%3A3&auto=format&fit=max&q=65&w=256", "https://imgix.businessinsider.com.au/content/uploads/sites/5/2022/02/28/iStock-961695104-e1646020558941.jpeg?ar=4%3A3&auto=format&fit=max&q=65&w=256", "https://imgix.businessinsider.com.au/content/uploads/sites/5/2022/01/25/iStock-973117190.jpg?ar=4%3A3&auto=format&fit=max&q=65&w=256", "https://imgix.businessinsider.com.au/content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/GettyImages-852625946.jpg?ar=4%3A3&auto=format&fit=max&q=65&w=256", "https://static.thisisinsider.com/image/5bc0bacda5a15c044559bc05.jpg", "https://i.insider.com/6231b550843ef30018e740a5?auto=webp&enable=upscale&fit=crop&format=jpeg&quality=85&width=256&height=192", "https://imgix.businessinsider.com.au/content/uploads/sites/5/2022/03/16/GettyImages-1047698926-e1647403580801.jpg?ar=4%3A3&auto=format&fit=max&q=65&w=256", "https://imgix.businessinsider.com.au/content/uploads/sites/5/2022/01/12/iStock-1271939618.jpg?ar=4%3A3&auto=format&fit=max&q=65&w=256", "https://static.thisisinsider.com/image/5b3f7f30c8d6ed4f008b458d.jpg", "https://imgix.businessinsider.com.au/content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/Auction.jpg?ar=4%3A3&auto=format&fit=max&q=65&w=256", "https://imgix.businessinsider.com.au/content/uploads/sites/5/2021/08/30/iStock-1212757122.jpg?ar=4%3A3&auto=format&fit=max&q=65&w=256", "https://imgix.businessinsider.com.au/content/uploads/sites/5/2021/08/02/GettyImages-1234278360.jpg?ar=4%3A3&auto=format&fit=max&q=65&w=256", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5049c2a51dc280b11d700bb6f84153b0?s=56&d=mm&r=g", "https://imgix.businessinsider.com.au/content/uploads/sites/5/2019/10/GettyImages-1180954684.jpg?ar=4%3A3&auto=format&fit=max&q=65&w=256", "https://imgix.businessinsider.com.au/content/uploads/sites/5/2022/02/14/iStock-1363326235-apple-ipad-airpods-macbook-pro-deals.jpg?ar=4%3A3&auto=format&fit=max&q=65&w=256", "https://static.thisisinsider.com/image/5bc0b2545143702b0243b326.jpg", "https://static.thisisinsider.com/image/5bc0af88a5a15c0176329652.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.thisisinsider.com/image/5bc0af88a5a15c0176329652.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lucy Yang", "Oct."], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/prince-william-kate-middleton-pda-princess-eugenie-wedding-2018-10", "title": "Prince William and Kate Middleton shared a rare moment of PDA at Princess Eugenie\u2019s wedding, and fans couldn\u2019t be happier", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge shared a sweet moment.
