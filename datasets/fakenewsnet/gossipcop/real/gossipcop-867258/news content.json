The fans have lived through so many changes, and this is only a new, different one, not a fearful one.\"[18] Chibnall said that he always wanted a woman for the part and that Whittaker was their first choice.[20]\n\nReaction to Whittaker's casting was mostly positive, although a \"sizeable minority\" was unhappy.[21] Some said that a female Doctor would be a good role model for young girls, while others felt the Doctor was only ever meant to be male, or criticised the casting as an exercise in political correctness.[22][23] Whittaker debuted in the 2017 Christmas special \"Twice Upon a Time\".[24][25]\n\nIn November 2018, the BBC confirmed that the twelfth series, Whittaker's second series, began production in November 2018.[26][27] Whittaker returned for the thirteenth series,[28] and is set to depart the programme following the series and three associated specials, to air by 2022.[29]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nWhittaker met Belizean-American actor and writer Christian Contreras in drama school, and they married in Arizona in 2008.[5] She gave birth to their daughter in April 2015.[30] They now live in London[1] and are expecting their second child in 2022.[31]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nStage [ edit ]\n\nRadio [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2008 Blinded by the Sun [47] BBC Radio 4 Unseen Austen Lydia Bennett[48]\n\nVideo games [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2019 Doctor Who: The Runaway The Doctor (voice) Virtual Reality game by BBC[49] Doctor Who: The Edge of Time The Doctor (voice) Virtual Reality game by Maze Theory[50] 2021 Doctor Who: The Lonely Assassins The Doctor (voice) Video Game by Maze Theory & Kaigan Games, Cameo Role[50] Doctor Who: The Edge of Reality The Doctor (voice) Video Game by Maze Theory[50]\n\nMusic [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Album/Project Notes 2019 Yellow Children in Need: Got It Covered Single (#5 on the Official Big Top 40)", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Jodie_Whittaker_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/1200px-Jodie_Whittaker_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Jodie_Whittaker_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/220px-Jodie_Whittaker_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Jodie_Whittaker_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/1200px-Jodie_Whittaker_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Whittaker", "title": "Jodie Whittaker", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.38.0-wmf.25", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Jodie_Whittaker_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/640px-Jodie_Whittaker_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 799}, "title": "Jodie Whittaker - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
