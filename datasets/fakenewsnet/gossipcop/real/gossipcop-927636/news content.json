They are set to take part in some Commonwealth events later this week.\n\nOn Monday, Harry said he is drawing inspiration from the Queen, 91, as \u201cthe ultimate source of guidance on all things Commonwealth,\u201d which is comprised of the 53 \u201cthriving family of nations\u201d linked to the U.K.\n\n\u201cOn the day of her 21st birthday, the then-Princess Elizabeth gave an extraordinary radio address from Cape Town. With an eye on the future, and an already unflinching sense of duty, she made a commitment,\u201d he told the delegates. \u201cShe said that whether her life be long or short, it would be dedicated to the service of the people of the Commonwealth.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom that speech in 1947 onwards, she has known that young people really make the difference,\u201d Harry continued. \u201cHer call to action was for her fellow young people to lead the way in making the Commonwealth a \u2018more free, more prosperous, more happy and a more powerful influence for good in the world.'\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The Look of Love!

You have made positive use of technology to build relationships within your communities, nations and across the globe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou care. You want your nations to be cleaner, your planet to be greener, your friends and neighbors to be treated fairly and with respect, no matter their ethnicity, their religion, or their status,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou are optimistic. The complicated challenges we face \u2013 climate change, inequality, conflict \u2013 they do not discourage you. Rather, they inspire you to persevere and effect change.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry And Meghan Markle Attend UK Team Trials For The Invictus Games Sydney 2018 Credit: Chris Jackson/Getty\n\nThe speech
