The fantasy of Katheryn went into Katy and made this bigger than life personality,\u201d Perry said, Australia\u2019s News Corp reported. \u201cThat\u2019s the point of this whole thing, if people can see I\u2019m just like them then they can dream just as big,\u201d\n\nTears (and mascara) running down her face, Perry also opened up about her past battles with alcohol \u2014 admitting that she had struggled with thoughts of suicide in the past, according to News Corp.\n\n\u201cI wrote a song about it,\u201d she said according to News Corp. \u201cI feel ashamed that I would have those thoughts, feel that low and that depressed.\u201d\n\nShe reportedly added: \u201cYou can be right or you can be loved.
