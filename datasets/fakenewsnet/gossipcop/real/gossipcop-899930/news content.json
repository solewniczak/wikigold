I would have fizzled away into the sunset,\" Stamos said.\n\nThe actor explained that, for a long time in his life, he thought that being a husband and a father was something he'd never get the chance to experience.\n\nJohn Stamos Says Life as a Dad Is 'More Beautiful Than I Imagined' (Exclusive) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page. John Stamos Says Life as a Dad Is 'More Beautiful Than I Imagined' (Exclusive)\n\n\"I wanted it, but for some reason, I just thought I missed that boat or that I didn't do enough good in the world and it wasn't going to come to me,\" he explained. \"And I made a real decision to just really find someone that great\u2026 and I did, luckily. And we have a beautiful baby boy now.\"\n\n\"It's better than I ever imagined,\" he added.\n\nSoon after welcoming their son, Stamos' wife told ET that the couple were already thinking about having more kids \"ASAP.\" According to the Full House alum, McHugh wasn't exaggerating.\n\n\"Caitlin wants one tonight!\" Stamos joked. \" This chocolate is an aphrodisiac, so I'm going to try for twins.\"\n\nAll kidding aside, Stamos said he feels the same as his wife, sharing, \"It would be great to have more kids for sure.\"\n\nFor more on the happy couple's adorable family, check out the
