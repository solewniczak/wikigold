Fall is the favorite season of the nation, with 29% responding that they prefer an autumnal climate. A winter chill is only preferred by 7% of us.\n\nSummertime activities like swimming, sunbathing and outdoor sports may be why the solstice rates higher among younger than older people. While for the majority (30%) of 18-34 year old Americans summer is their favorite season, this is the case for just 20% of those aged 55 and over. 37% of 55s and older prefer spring above all \u2013 the perfect time of year for gardening and enjoying the warmer weather before the height of summer. The biggest proportion of winter fans was in the West and the South \u2013 where temperatures can reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit in July \u2013 as 14% of westerners and 11% of southerners prefer cooler climes.\n\nThose living in America\u2019s Heartland came out as the most dissatisfied with their climate. 33% living in the Midwest disliked the weather in their region, compared with just 19% in the West, 19% in the Northeast and 20% in the South. The weather in Midwestern states like Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio vary greatly. But without a coast to moderate temperatures, summers can be scorching hot and winters frosty.\n\nAmericans least likely to complain about the weather live in the West; 66% felt they either \u2018somewhat\u2019 or \u2018really\u2019 like their local climate. States like California, Washington and Wyoming make this category \u2013 but also Alaska, which can reach temperatures as low as -9 degrees Fahrenheit in certain regions. Naturally, there are always residents who have a gripe with the weather where they live. Out of those who disliked their local climate, YouGov found:\n\n68% of those who dislike living in the NORTHEAST say it is too cold.\n\nOf those who dislike living in the MIDWEST 62% say it is too cold, but 26% say it is too hot.\n\n70% of Americans living in the SOUTH who dislike the weather say it is too hot.\n\nThere is disagreement in the WEST as 26% of those who dislike its weather say it is too rainy and 36% say it is too dry.\n\nIt seems that \u2013 sun or sleet, rain or shine \u2013 there\u2019s no pleasing everyone when it comes to the changeable American weather.", "images": ["https://d18lkz4dllo6v2.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/entry/41333/GettyImages-1238864137.jpg?pw=336", "https://d18lkz4dllo6v2.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/entry/41054/shoes.jpg?pw=336", "https://d18lkz4dllo6v2.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/entry/2022-02-02/GettyImages-1214156108%201.jpg?pw=336", "https://d18lkz4dllo6v2.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/entry/6298/weather.jpg?pw=1200", "https://d39be2hlyrutg8.cloudfront.net/1596cc9b/assets/images/svg/logo-us.svg", "https://d18lkz4dllo6v2.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/entry/41009/love-language.jpg?pw=336", "https://d18lkz4dllo6v2.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/entry/40644/love-choice-pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3967023.jpg?pw=336", "https://d18lkz4dllo6v2.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/entry/40855/covid-image.jpeg?pw=336", "https://d18lkz4dllo6v2.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/entry/2022-01-20/GettyImages-1333137251.jpg?pw=336", "https://d18lkz4dllo6v2.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/entry/40950/Super-Bowl-GettyImages-1367760053.png?pw=336", "https://d18lkz4dllo6v2.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/entry/40978/valentines-hearts-pexels-karolina-grabowska-5713581.jpg?pw=336"], "top_img": "https://d18lkz4dllo6v2.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/entry/6298/weather.jpg?pw=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2013/06/10/fall-favorite-season-most-americans-33-heartland-l", "title": "Fall is favorite season for most Americans; 33% in Heartland least happy with the weather", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "While weather predictions can be unreliable, it is safe to say that a quarter of Americans are looking forward to the summer months.In a survey of the four seasons, summer rates high as 25% of Americans look forward to the warmer weather.
