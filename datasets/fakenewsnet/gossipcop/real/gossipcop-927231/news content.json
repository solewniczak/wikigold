The thing with this is they\u2019re showing me double-edged sword, double-edged sword. So when they do that that\u2019s their way of acknowledging that whatever good quality they had also might have been the thing that caused some torment internally.\u201d\n\nluanne-de-lesseps-hollywood-medium Credit: E!\n\n\u201cDo you know of any situations pertinent to any individual dying at a premature age that contributed to their passing?\u201d Henry asked de Lesseps.\n\n\u201cYeah, the owner of the restaurant. He was a friend of mine,\u201d de Lesseps revealed. \u201cAnd he was very creative\u2026 but his own worst enemy in a way.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s having me acknowledge he actually took his life,\u201d Henry said.\n\n\u201cLife was a cabaret for Jean-Claude. He was a man who liked to put on a great show,\u201d de Lesseps said. \u201cBut you can tell there was a certain amount of sadness there and loneliness that I\u2019m sure a lot of people didn\u2019t realize. So, it was a surprise when he passed.\u201d\n\nBaker, son of Josephine Baker, died in 2015 at the age of 71. He was found dead inside of Mercedes which had been running in the enclosed garage of his East Hampton, N.Y., home, according to The New York Times.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

He does not feel alone anymore. He comes through absolutely lovely. He\u2019s very free.\u201d\n\nThe reality star let out a deep sigh, saying on camera, \u201cWhen Tyler said that you know don\u2019t worry about Jean-Claude, he\u2019s good, he\u2019s happy.
