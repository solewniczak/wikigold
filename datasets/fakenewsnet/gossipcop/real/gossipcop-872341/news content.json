The standalone show is a spin-off of Corden's popular late-night segment on \"The Late Late Show.\"\n\nCorden kicked off the new series' inaugural show the best way he knows how: jamming out. With Smith in the passenger seat, the tunes were hand-picked from some of the actor-musician's 1990s repertoire, including \"Gettin' Jiggy Wit It\" and \"Boom! Shake the Room.\"\n\nSmith also revealed that he's been in talks to play Barack Obama in a film. And by \"in talks,\" Smith means he's talked about it before -- with Barack Obama, no less. The former president's response?\n\n\"He told me that he felt confident that I had the ears for the role,\" Smith quipped.\n\nYouTube offers a clipped version of the episode, though it hits several of the show's major moments, including Corden and Smith singing \"Gettin' Jiggy Wit It\" alongside a full marching band.\n\nThe full version, available exclusively on Apple Music, features several additional karaoke jingles, notably the \"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" theme song. Obviously.\n\nThe video above also teases other \"Carpool Karaoke\" performances, including \"Game of Thrones\" stars Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner's spirited rendition of Miley Cyrus' \"Wrecking Ball.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170810095655im_/http://www.trbimg.com/img-598b53db/turbine/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-august-carpool-karaoke-watch-will-smith-and-1502295571"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170810095655im_/http://www.trbimg.com/img-598b53db/turbine/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-august-carpool-karaoke-watch-will-smith-and-1502295571", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Mae Czachor"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170810095655/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-august-carpool-karaoke-watch-will-smith-and-1502295571-htmlstory.html", "title": "Watch Will Smith and James Corden get jiggy with it on 'Carpool Karaoke'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "x-servername": "i13prod-b3f17b0-0-142.1", "robots": "index,follow", "author": "Emily Mae Czachor", "date": "2017-08-09", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 Los Angeles Times", "Description": "James Corden is back in the carpool lane, with Will Smith riding shotgun.The debut episode of Apple Music's new iteration of the \"Carpo...", "fb_title": "Watch Will Smith and James Corden get jiggy with it on 'Carpool Karaoke'", "og": {"title": "Watch Will Smith and James Corden get jiggy with it on 'Carpool Karaoke'", "description": "James Corden is back in the carpool lane, with Will Smith riding shotgun.The debut episode of Apple Music's new iteration of the \"Carpo...", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170810095655/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-august-carpool-karaoke-watch-will-smith-and-1502295571-htmlstory.html", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170810095655im_/http://www.trbimg.com/img-598b53db/turbine/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-august-carpool-karaoke-watch-will-smith-and-1502295571", "site_name": "latimes.com"}, "fb": {"page_id": 5863113009, "admins": 100000786395051}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@latimes"}, "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "googlebot": "index", "googlebot-news": "index", "so": {"status": "0,1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502318520.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
