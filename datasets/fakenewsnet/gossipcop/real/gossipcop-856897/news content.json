During a Good Morning America appearance, Chris Pine revealed he still uses a flip phone, Us Weekly reports.\n\nWhen host Michael Strahan quizzed the Woman Wonder star on his biggest quirk, Pine responded, \u201cI have a flip phone.\u201d He added, \u201cThe flip world is a whole world you gotta get into.\u201d\n\nUh, yeah\u2026except we\u2019ve already been there, Chris. FYI, your fossil of a phone is officially one of those early 2000 cell phones we loved, emphasis on the word early.\n\nBut before we rib Pine too much for living that throwback tech lifestyle, the reason he still uses a flip phone actually makes a lot of sense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, here we go,\u201d Pine explained. \u201cI recently got a record player and a flip phone. I kind of like the simplifying down. I just like the simple, I just like the non-complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be connected so much.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s actually super relatable. Without a smartphone, there\u2019s no temptation to be plugged in all the time. They don\u2019t support all the apps that suck up a ton of our time and energy, which means no accidentally tweeting someone\u2019s phone number or worrying about your kids getting their little hands on your iPhone and spending an ungodly amount of money on in-app purchases.\n\nThe Star Trek actor isn\u2019t the one knocking the dust off a flip phone. We won\u2019t soon forget the frenzy that occurred after everyone noticed Adele using a flip phone in the \u201cHello\u201d video, and earlier this year Ed Sheeran admitted to using a flip phone to avoid social media.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F02%2F09%2FSwimsuits.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Fyuliya-kosolapova-bqirdOGHvYQ-unsplash-e1573767747444.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/misc/300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F07%2F08%2Fchiron-retrograde-2021.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fdream_about_ex.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1024&h=512&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F05%2F24%2Fchrispine1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F06%2F08%2Ffriendquestions-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F17%2Fboob-sweat.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F20%2Fsex-anxiety-tout.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1024&h=512&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F05%2F24%2Fchrispine1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kenya Foy", "Updated May"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/lifestyle/nostalgia/chris-pine-still-uses-flip-phone/", "title": "Chris Pine still uses a flip phone for the most relatable reason ever", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Chris Pine uses a flip phone because he likes to keep life simple, and we *totally* get it.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Chris Pine still uses a flip phone for the most relatable reason ever", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/lifestyle/nostalgia/chris-pine-still-uses-flip-phone/", "description": "Chris Pine uses a flip phone because he likes to keep life simple, and we *totally* get it.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1024&h=512&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F05%2F24%2Fchrispine1.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 512}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/lifestyle/nostalgia/chris-pine-still-uses-flip-phone/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F05%2F24%2Fchrispine1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/lifestyle/nostalgia/chris-pine-still-uses-flip-phone/", "title": "Chris Pine still uses a flip phone for the most relatable reason ever", "description": "Chris Pine uses a flip phone because he likes to keep life simple, and we *totally* get it.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1024&h=512&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2017%2F05%2F24%2Fchrispine1.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/lifestyle/nostalgia/chris-pine-still-uses-flip-phone/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
