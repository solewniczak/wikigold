She\u2019s returned a number of times since, namely in seasons 11 and 13.\n\nThe character, whom EW ranked as the No. 1 SVU ADA, joins a number of other familiar faces who have returned in season 18, including Dean Winters and Sam Waterston. The news also comes on the heels of Ra\u00fal Esparza, who played ADA Barba, exiting as a series regular.\n\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F03%2Fgettyimages-138261511-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F03%2Fgettyimages-138261511-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F09%2F19%2Fnatalie-abrams-image.png"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F03%2Fgettyimages-138261511-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Abrams", "March", "At Pm Est"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/03/05/law-order-svu-stephanie-march/", "title": "Law & Order: SVU: Stephanie March returning as guest star", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "Get details on Alex Cabot's return to SVU", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Stephanie March returning as guest star on 'Law & Order: SVU'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/03/05/law-order-svu-stephanie-march/", "description": "Get details on Alex Cabot's return to SVU", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F03%2Fgettyimages-138261511-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/03/05/law-order-svu-stephanie-march/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F03%2Fgettyimages-138261511-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/03/05/law-order-svu-stephanie-march/", "title": "Stephanie March returning as guest star on 'Law & Order: SVU'", "description": "Get details on Alex Cabot's return to SVU", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F03%2Fgettyimages-138261511-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/03/05/law-order-svu-stephanie-march/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520204400.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
