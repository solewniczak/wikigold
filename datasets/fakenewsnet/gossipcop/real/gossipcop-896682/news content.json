You can even use the highlighter as a shadow on the eyes and then add the gloss on top. It\u2019s really versatile.\u201d\n\nThis comes after the successful launches of her KKW Beauty Contour Kits and KKW Fragrance, which sold out all three fragrances (Crystal Gardenia, Crystal Gardenia Citrus and Crystal Gardenia ) in six days for about $14 million in total.\n\nThough Kardashian West has yet to preview the products themselves, fans got a first look at the highlighters and glosses thanks to makeup artist and beauty influencer Huda Kattan, who was the first to show off the never-before-seen products from KKW Beauty on Monday.\n\nAs seen in Kattan\u2019s photo, each product comes in sparkly copper, bronze, rose gold, gold and silver tones, meaning you can match lip glosses and highlighting powders.\n\n2017 LACMA Art + Film Gala Honoring Mark Bradford And George Lucas - Arrivals Kim Kardashian West at the 2017 LACMA Art + Film Gala | Credit: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nBut turns out, Kardashian West was already testing out the new beauty items for months without any of us knowing.\n\nThe Alexander Wang fashion show during New York Fashion Week in September was the first time she teased her newest products. And earlier this month, the Internet started speculating the star would be launching lip products when her makeup artist didn\u2019t reveal the lipstick she used at the LACMA Art + Film Gala.\n\n\u201cIt was the most satisfying feeling when friends, makeup artists, everyone was like, \u2018What is this lip liner?\u2019 \u201d Kardashian West told PEOPLE recently. \u201cLip liners and lipsticks. I\u2019m so excited for them to come out. It\u2019s gonna be so good.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fkim-kardashian-21-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fkim-kardashian-west.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fkim-kardashian-west.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi", "November"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/kim-kardashian-poses-in-nothing-but-glitter-for-kkw-beauty/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Poses in Nothing but Glitter for New KKW Beauty Line", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Kim Kardashian,News", "news_keywords": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Kim Kardashian,News", "description": "Kardashian West's highlighters and glosses launch Dec. 1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Poses in Nothing but Glitter for New KKW Beauty Line", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/kim-kardashian-poses-in-nothing-but-glitter-for-kkw-beauty/", "description": "Kardashian West's highlighters and glosses launch Dec. 1", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fkim-kardashian-west.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/style/kim-kardashian-poses-in-nothing-but-glitter-for-kkw-beauty/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fkim-kardashian-west.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/style/kim-kardashian-poses-in-nothing-but-glitter-for-kkw-beauty/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Poses in Nothing but Glitter for New KKW Beauty Line", "description": "Kardashian West's highlighters and glosses launch Dec. 1", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fkim-kardashian-west.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/style/kim-kardashian-poses-in-nothing-but-glitter-for-kkw-beauty/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
