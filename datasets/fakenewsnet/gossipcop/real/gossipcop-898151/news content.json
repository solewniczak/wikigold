Law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit. I have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one. In this country, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty. However, in the current climate, it seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused. I understand and look forward to clearing my name once and for all. In the meantime, I want to express my gratitude to the cast and crew that I\u2019ve worked so closely with over the past three seasons. I wish them nothing but success. I am also so thankful to the fans that have supported me and continue to do so.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F08%2Fdanny-masterson-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1517&h=759&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F08%2Fdanny-masterson-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1517&h=759&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F08%2Fdanny-masterson-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios", "December"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/danny-masterson-fired-netflix-sexual-assault-allegations/", "title": "Danny Masterson 'Very Disappointed' After Being Fired by Netflix Amid Sexual Assault Allegations", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Ashton Kutcher,Danny Masterson,Netflix,News,Sexual Assault,That '70s Show", "news_keywords": "Ashton Kutcher,Danny Masterson,Netflix,News,Sexual Assault,That '70s Show", "description": "Danny Masterson is currently under investigation\u00a0by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County District Attorney", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Danny Masterson 'Very Disappointed' After Being Fired by Netflix Amid Sexual Assault Allegations", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/danny-masterson-fired-netflix-sexual-assault-allegations/", "description": "Danny Masterson is currently under investigation\u00a0by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County District Attorney", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1517&h=759&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F08%2Fdanny-masterson-2000.jpg", "width": 1517, "height": 759}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/danny-masterson-fired-netflix-sexual-assault-allegations/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F08%2Fdanny-masterson-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/danny-masterson-fired-netflix-sexual-assault-allegations/", "title": "Danny Masterson 'Very Disappointed' After Being Fired by Netflix Amid Sexual Assault Allegations", "description": "Danny Masterson is currently under investigation\u00a0by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County District Attorney", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1517&h=759&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F08%2Fdanny-masterson-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/danny-masterson-fired-netflix-sexual-assault-allegations/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
