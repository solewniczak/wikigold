Tomlin had a sharper guess: \u201cI think before your first face lift!\u201d Fonda then joked to Tomlin, \u201cWho are you, Megyn Kelly?\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Kelly, 47, reminded her audience that the actress had appeared on her show to promote Our Souls at Night, a movie about aging.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, most older women look nothing like Fonda, who is now 80,\u201d the host said. \u201cAnd if Fonda really wants to have an honest discussion about older women\u2019s cultural face, then her plastic surgery is tough to ignore. Fonda herself knows this, and that is why \u2014 to her credit \u2014 she\u2019s discussed her cosmetic surgery pretty much everywhere before coming on our show.\u201d\n\nJaneFondaMegynKelly3 Jane Fonda and Megyn Kelly\n\nAfter showing a reel of Fonda openly talking about having work done in other interviews over the years, Kelly continued that there was no way for her to know that suddenly the topic was taboo.\n\n\u201cLook, I gave her a chance to empower other women, young and old, on a subject which she purports to know well, and she rejected it \u2014 that\u2019s okay,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut I have no regrets about that question, nor am I in the market for a lesson from Jane Fonda on what is and is not appropriate. After all, this is a woman whose name is synonymous with outrage. \u201d\n\nKelly then addressed Fonda\u2019s controversial actions during the Vietnam War, including calling prisoners of wars \u201chypocrites and liars\u201d whose torture was \u201cunderstandable,\u201d attempting to shame troops through radio broadcasts and posing on an anti-aircraft gun used against American pilots. Kelly also noted that Fonda apologized years later for the gun photo but claimed she still says she\u2019s not proud of the country, causing many veterans to refer to the actress as \u201cHanoi Jane.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe moral indignation is a little much,\u201d Kelly concluded. \u201cShe put her plastic surgery out there. She said she wanted to discuss the plight of older women in America. And honestly, she has no business lecturing anyone on what qualifies as offensive.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Fonda apologized for the incendiary photo.\n\n\u201cWhenever possible I try to sit down with vets and talk with them, because I understand and it makes me sad,\u201d she said. \u201cIt hurts me and it will to my grave that I made a huge, huge mistake that made a lot of people think I was against the soldiers.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Megyn Kelly Asked Jane Fonda About Plastic Surgery \u2013 and Jane Was Not Having It\n\nSpeaking with Variety about her new documentary, Jane Fonda in Five Acts, Fonda addressed the awkward moment when Kelly attempted a line of questioning about going under the knife. Fonda appeared uncomfortable by the question, staring back Kelly with bewilderment and pausing for a few seconds before finally asking, \u201cWe really want to talk about that right now?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I was upset. I was stunned,\u201d Fonda explained in the new interview. \u201cIt was so inappropriate. It showed that she\u2019s not that good of an interviewer.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F11%2Fjanefondamegynkelly3-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F11%2Fjanefondamegynkelly3-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F11%2Fjanefondamegynkelly3-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit", "January"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/megyn-kelly-addresses-jane-fonda-plastic-surgery-question/", "title": "Megyn Kelly Claps Back at Jane Fonda Over Plastic Surgery Question, References 'Hanoi Jane'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Jane Fonda,Megyn Kelly,News,Plastic Surgery", "news_keywords": "Jane Fonda,Megyn Kelly,News,Plastic Surgery", "description": "Nearly four months after\u00a0Jane Fonda\u00a0shut down a question about her plastic surgery, Megyn Kelly addressed Fonda's own controversial past", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Megyn Kelly Claps Back at Jane Fonda Over Plastic Surgery Question, References 'Hanoi Jane'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/megyn-kelly-addresses-jane-fonda-plastic-surgery-question/", "description": "Nearly four months after\u00a0Jane Fonda\u00a0shut down a question about her plastic surgery, Megyn Kelly addressed Fonda's own controversial past", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F11%2Fjanefondamegynkelly3-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/megyn-kelly-addresses-jane-fonda-plastic-surgery-question/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F11%2Fjanefondamegynkelly3-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/megyn-kelly-addresses-jane-fonda-plastic-surgery-question/", "title": "Megyn Kelly Claps Back at Jane Fonda Over Plastic Surgery Question, References 'Hanoi Jane'", "description": "Nearly four months after\u00a0Jane Fonda\u00a0shut down a question about her plastic surgery, Megyn Kelly addressed Fonda's own controversial past", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F11%2Fjanefondamegynkelly3-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/megyn-kelly-addresses-jane-fonda-plastic-surgery-question/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
