The hardest thing is seeing pain on someone\u2019s face that you caused, and then have to deal with yourself,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cSo, you know, most people don\u2019t want to do that. You don\u2019t want to look inside yourself.

Every emotion is connected and it comes from somewhere. And just being aware of it. Being aware of it in everyday life puts you at such a \u2026 you\u2019re at such an advantage.\u201d\n\nThe artist \u2014 nominated for eight awards at the 2018 Grammys \u2014 said he built up walls due to experiences from his childhood.\n\n\u201cYou go into survival mode, and when you go into survival mode what happen? You shut down all emotions. So even with women, you gonna shut down emotionally, so you can\u2019t connect [because of the way you feel about yourself],\u201d he said. \u201cIn my case, like it\u2019s, it\u2019s deep.
