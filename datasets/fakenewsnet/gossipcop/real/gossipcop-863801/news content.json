It's definitely an exciting and very busy time for the expectant mother, but she's not letting her pregnancy slow down her style game. Yesterday, the 35-year-old English socialite took a fashion-forward trip to the grocery store. And we are taking notes \u2014 pregnant or not \u2014 because she has found the formula for an easy-going on-trend outfit.\n\nMiddleton's maternity uniform boils down to three elements: a perfect pair of sneakers, a loose-fitting dress, and a large tote. Most recently, she made heads turn in a flowy Ralph Lauren polka-dot dress ($398; mytheresa.com), which was anchored with trendy white sneakers. She consistently returns to her comfortable, investment-worthy Jimmy Choo sneakers ($495; saks.com). We've spotted her wearing them over and over again.\n\nRELATED: Pregnant Pippa Middleton Can't Stop Wearing These Comfortable $120 Wedges\n\nAbove, Middleton paired the white kicks with a fox-print Kate Spade New York dress ($348; neimanmarcus.com).\n\nRELATED: Does Pippa Middleton's Baby Get a Royal Title?\n\nAnd here, her sneaks added a cool factor to her now sold-out Claudie Pierlot dress.
