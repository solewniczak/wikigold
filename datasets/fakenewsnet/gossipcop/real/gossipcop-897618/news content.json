After knowing Shelton for years (Blackstock is his manager), Clarkson started spending time and talking with Stefani after she began dating the country superstar. Clarkson is a big fan of the No Doubt singer, and she says Stefani is the \"most chill girl ever.\"\n\nClarkson told E! News that at first, she was nervous to hang out with the \"Rich Girl\" singer, but Stefani is such a cool lady that the two instantly became friends. She added that all it takes is meeting Stefani one time and you feel close to her.\n\nThe former American Idol winner says she and her husband double-dated with Stefani and Shelton at Stefani's home, which she called \"magnificent.\" She says the first time she walked in, it was like the scene from Pretty Woman where Julia Roberts didn't belong in the store.\n\nWhen she was at Stefani's home, she also got the chance to meet members of her family, who Clarkson says are \"super rad\" and \"down to earth.\"\n\nClarkson also revealed what it's like to be part of group texts with her husband and the superstar couple. She says Stefani always starts out with something sweet and positive to say, then she and Shelton take it somewhere else. Clarkson and Shelton are quite competitive, and since they both have songs and albums coming out, they constantly remind each other where they are on the charts. She says their competitive banter is something they will have to get used to since she will be a coach on The Voice next season.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/75bc5f8f-bdb6-4450-8b34-19f657ce2327.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/321961ff-cff3-4da3-bb15-92c6c100f5d4.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/cb72b1bf-36aa-44a8-a6c7-835711fcfff0.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/cebf4a39-5da0-4fe2-abd5-23660bca8979.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/b61a3fab-062d-497a-9cba-8ea4f2d4a966.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5ed34468ceaaad942f0b4277ee61d2b2?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/0bb6f898-74de-4517-965d-61d4feb5ccf4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4665386/kelly-clarkson-reveals-what-its-like-to-double-date-with-blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani/", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Reveals What It's Like To Double Date With Blake Shelton And Gwen Stefani", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Reveals What It's Like To Double Date With Blake Shelton And Gwen Stefani", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4665386/kelly-clarkson-reveals-what-its-like-to-double-date-with-blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Kelly Clarkson Reveals What It's Like To Double Date With Blake Shelton And Gwen Stefani", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-12-05 10:37:09Z", "section": "Famous Relationships"}, "description": "Kelly Clarkson Reveals What It's Like To Double Date With Blake Shelton And Gwen Stefani", "keywords": "Famous Relationships", "news_keywords": "Famous Relationships", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512470229.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
