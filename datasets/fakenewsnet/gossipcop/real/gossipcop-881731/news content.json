At just 16, the daughter of supermodel Cindy Crawford went from taking her driver\u2019s test to making her runway debut at Calvin Klein a few days later\u2014and that was just the beginning of her adventure. Instantly becoming the model of the moment, Gerber spent her very first New York Fashion Week walking for Alexander Wang, Marc Jacobs, and even Rihanna. Not bad for a newbie, though Gerber isn\u2019t your ordinary rising star.\n\nAs seen behind the scenes of her big week, Gerber didn\u2019t just conquer the runways, she took all of New York by storm, and everywhere she went, she brought a little fashion magic with her. Chilling in a suite at the Plaza with fellow teen stars Cara Taylor and Faretta, she turned room service into a mini editorial; later dancing in Times Square, she gave tourists an eyeful of the latest runway looks. Playing on set in sparkling Gucci, Gerber found the humor in that infamous crystal-covered bodysuit, and posing in a downtown alleyway, she even pulled onlookers into the shoot.", "images": ["https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.f2c4cf0289092a5686b7c6db87806b427e705af9.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.00b68c0d9934396a2a234f4f43427e3affd58e9b.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.02dcb2fef16d86c695ce8d290a3fd13c7f6c3182.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59c1a195f298de1d75c9f736/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kaia-1-H.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59c1a195f298de1d75c9f736/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kaia-1-H.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Janelle Okwodu"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kaia-gerber-supermodel-first-new-york-fashion-week-spring-2018", "title": "Relive Kaia Gerber\u2019s First New York Fashion Week\u2014A Total Teenage Dream", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Bringing charm and personality to her first Fashion Week, Kaia Gerber takes the runway to the street.", "id": "59b9aeb32d209a0e601aff4b", "keywords": "spring 2018 ready-to-wear,new york fashion week,supermodels!", "news_keywords": "spring 2018 ready-to-wear,new york fashion week,supermodels!", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59b9aeb32d209a0e601aff4b", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Bringing charm and personality to her first Fashion Week, Kaia Gerber takes the runway to the street.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59c1a195f298de1d75c9f736/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Kaia-1-H.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59c1a195f298de1d75c9f736/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Kaia-1-H.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Bringing charm and personality to her first Fashion Week, Kaia Gerber takes the runway to the street.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59c1a195f298de1d75c9f736/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kaia-1-H.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Relive Kaia Gerber\u2019s First New York Fashion Week\u2014A Total Teenage Dream", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kaia-gerber-supermodel-first-new-york-fashion-week-spring-2018"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-09-20T13:00:00.000Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59c1a195f298de1d75c9f736/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kaia-1-H.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505912400.0, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
