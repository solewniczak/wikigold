The series was ordered by the streaming service Hulu as a straight-to-series order of 10 episodes, for which production began in late 2016. The plot features a dystopia following a Second American Civil War wherein a sexist totalitarian society subjects fertile women, called \"Handmaids\", to child-bearing slavery.[5]\n\nThe first three episodes of the series premiered on April 26, 2017; the subsequent seven episodes were released every Wednesday. In July 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season,[6] which premiered on April 27, 2021.[7] In September 2019, it was announced that Hulu and MGM were developing a sequel series, to be based on Atwood's 2019 novel The Testaments.[8] In December 2020, ahead of the fourth season premiere, the series was renewed for a fifth season.[9]\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale's first season won eight Primetime Emmy Awards from 13 nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series. It is the first show produced by Hulu to win a major award as well as the first series on a streaming service to win an Emmy for Outstanding Series.[10] It also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Drama. Elisabeth Moss was also awarded the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Television Drama Series.\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nIn a world where fertility rates have collapsed as a result of sexually transmitted diseases and environmental pollution,[11] the totalitarian, theonomic government of Gilead establishes rule in the former United States in the aftermath of a civil war.[12][13][14] Society is organized by power-hungry leaders along with a new, militarized, hierarchical regime of religious fanaticism and newly created social classes, in which women are brutally subjugated. By law, women in Gilead are forced to work in very limited roles, including some as natal slaves, and they are not allowed to own property, have careers, handle money, or read.[14]\n\nWorld infertility has led to the enslavement of fertile women in Gilead determined by the new regime to be \"fallen women\", citing an extremist interpretation of the Biblical account of Bilhah; these women often include those who have entered multiple marriages (termed \"adulteresses\", as divorce is not recognised under Gileadian law), single or unmarried mothers, lesbians (homosexuals being termed \"gender traitors\"), non-Christians, adherents of Christian denominations other than the \"Sons of Jacob\", political dissidents, and academics. These women, called Handmaids, are assigned to the homes of the ruling elite, where they must submit to ritualized rape (referred to as \"the ceremony\") by their male masters (\"Commanders\") in the presence of their wives, to be impregnated and bear children for them.[14] Handmaids are given names created by the addition of the prefix Of- to the first name of the man who has them. When they are transferred, their names are changed.\n\nAlong with the Handmaids, much of society is now grouped into classes that dictate their freedoms and duties. Women are divided into a small range of social categories, each one signified by a plain dress in a specific color. Handmaids wear long red dresses, heavy brown boots and white coifs, with a larger white coif (known as \"wings\") to be worn outside, concealing them from public view and restricting their vision.\n\nJune Osborne, renamed Offred, is the Handmaid assigned to the home of the Gileadan Commander Fred Waterford and his wife Serena Joy. The Waterfords, key players in the formation and rise of Gilead, struggle with the realities of the society they helped create. During \"the time before\", June was married to Luke and had a daughter, Hannah. At the beginning of the story, while attempting to flee Gilead with her husband and daughter, June was captured and forced to become a Handmaid because of the adultery she and her husband committed. June's daughter was taken and given to an upper-class family to raise, and her husband escaped into Canada. Much of the plot revolves around June's desire to be reunited with her husband and daughter and the internal evolution of her strength to its somewhat darker version.\n\nCast and characters [ edit ]\n\nMain [ edit ]\n\nElisabeth Moss as June Osborne / Offred / Ofjoseph, a woman who was captured while attempting to escape to Canada with her husband, Luke, and daughter, Hannah.

The site's critical consensus reads, \"Haunting and vivid, The Handmaid's Tale is an endlessly engrossing adaptation of Margaret Atwood's dystopian novel that's anchored by a terrific central performance from Elisabeth Moss.\"[83] On Metacritic, the season has a weighted average score of 92 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[84]\n\nDaniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"probably the spring's best new show\".[91] Jen Chaney of Vulture gave it a highly positive review, and wrote that it is \"A faithful adaptation of the book that also brings new layers to Atwood's totalitarian, sexist world of forced surrogate motherhood\" and that \"this series is meticulously paced, brutal, visually stunning, and so suspenseful from moment to moment that only at the end of each hour will you feel fully at liberty to exhale\".[92]\n\nThere was much debate on whether parallels could be drawn between the series (and by extension, the book it is based on) and American society during the Presidency of Donald Trump.[93][94] Comparisons have also been made to the Salafi/Wahabbi extremism of ISIS, under which enslaved women of religious minorities are passed around and utilized as sex objects and vessels to bear new jihadis.[95][96][97]\n\nSeason 2 [ edit ]\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, 89% of 340 critics have given the season a positive review, and an average rating of 8.36/10.

The Atlantic's Sophie Gilbert wrote: \"There came a point during the first episode where, for me, it became too much.\"[98] Lisa Miller of The Cut wrote: \"I have pressed mute and fast forward so often this season, I am forced to wonder: 'Why am I watching this'? It all feels so gratuitous, like a beating that never ends.\"[99] The Daily Telegraph's Rebecca Reid admitted she had an anxiety attack watching an episode of the show.[100]\n\nSeason 3 [ edit ]\n\nFor the third season, Rotten Tomatoes reports that 82% of 301 reviews are positive, and the average rating is 6.92/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The Handmaid's Tale's third season reins in its horrors and inspires hope that revolution really is possible \u2013 if only the story would stop spinning its wheels and get to it already.\"[87] Metacritic compiled 14 critic reviews and an average score of 68 out of 100, signifying \"generally favorable reviews\".[88]\n\nKelly Lawler of USA Today gave it a positive review, scoring it three out of four stars. She claimed it is an improvement over the second season, \"that rights many \u2013 though definitely not all \u2013 of Season 2's wrongs.\" Overall, she wrote, \"The new season is more propulsive and watchable, although it doesn't quite reach the heights of that first moving season. But Handmaid's regains its footing by setting off on a new path\".[101]\n\nDaniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a generally positive review, praising Elisabeth Moss's performance and the cinematography, but criticized the plot \"that has become frustratingly repetitive\". Overall, he wrote, \"Still occasionally powerful, but rarely as provocative\".[102]\n\nSeason 4 [ edit ]\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the fourth season earned positive reviews from 69% of 45 critics, with an average rating of 7.18/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Elisabeth Moss is better than ever, but scattershot plotting and an overbearing sense of doom may prove too grim for some viewers to really enjoy The Handmaid's Tale's fourth season.\"[89] According to Metacritic, which collected 18 reviews and calculated an average score of 62, the season received \"generally positive reviews\".[90]\n\nKristen Baldwin of Entertainment Weekly gave it a \"C+\" grade and wrote that the series \"delivers on some long-delayed promises, but ultimately it's too little, too late.\"[103] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe wrote, \"the dystopian drama has exceeded the natural lifespan of its story, as it plows forward with nothing new to say, tinkling cymbals and sounding brass.\"[104] In a more positive review from Jen Chaney of Vulture, she wrote, \"Thankfully, season four finally regains some momentum and forward motion. Based on the eight out of ten total episodes made available to critics, this is the best The Handmaid's Tale has been since its first season.\"[105]\n\nAwards [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]", "images": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_intertitle.png/1200px-The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_intertitle.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/34px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_intertitle.png/250px-The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_intertitle.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_intertitle.png/1200px-The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_intertitle.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_(TV_series)", "title": "The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.38.0-wmf.25", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_intertitle.png/640px-The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_intertitle.png", "width": 640, "height": 360}, "title": "The Handmaid's Tale (TV series) - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
