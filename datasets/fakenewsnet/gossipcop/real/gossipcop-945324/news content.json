And then it goes No. 1 because it\u2019s a dude. But you know \u2014 if we went and looked at how many singles or records were sold for the Top 10 songs right now, I\u2019d probably triple it on record sales. So it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Lambert\u2019s most recent album, 2016\u2019s The Weight of These Wings, was certified platinum last year, selling more than one million copies.\n\nDespite her chart appearances over the years, Lambert has become a Nashville powerhouse with two Grammy Awards, 23 Academy of Country Music Awards and 13 Country Music Association Awards. And Wednesday night, the singer is nominated for three more CMAs: favorite female vocalist, as well as single of the year and musical event of the year for \u201cDrowns the Whiskey.\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s representation on the radio and in country music has been an important discussion for years. In 2015, a male radio consultant sparked a renewed vigor in that conversation when he compared female artists to \u201ctomatoes\u201d in a \u201csalad\u201d of male artists, since dubbed \u201cTomato Gate.\u201d\n\nmiranda-lambert Credit: Jim Wright\n\n\u201cI feel like shutting that door on \u2018women don\u2019t want to hear women\u2019 because that\u2019s BS,\u201d Underwood said on the Women Want to Hear Women podcast in September.\n\n\u201cEven when I was growing up, I wished there were more women on the radio. And I had a lot more than there is today. Think about all of the little girls that are sitting at home saying, \u2018I want to be a country music singer.\u2019 What do you tell them? What do you do?\u201d the expectant Underwood continued. \u201cHow do you look at them and say, \u2018Well, just work hard, sweetie, and you can do it,\u2019 When that\u2019s\u2026 not the case right now.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fmiranda-lambert5-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1501&h=751&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fmiranda-lambert5-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1501&h=751&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fmiranda-lambert5-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeff Nelson", "November"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/country/miranda-lambert-had-sing-with-man-to-get-number-one-hit/", "title": "Miranda Lambert Slams Sexism in Music: 'I Had to Sing with Someone with a Penis' to Hit No. 1", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "CMA Awards,Miranda Lambert,News", "news_keywords": "CMA Awards,Miranda Lambert,News", "description": "\"It is interesting that I haven't had even a Top 20 in a long, long time.
