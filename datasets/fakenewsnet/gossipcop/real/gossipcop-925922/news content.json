I came back to Winter Games because I\u2019ve seen this franchise work miracles before,\u201d she continued. \u201cThrough The Bachelor and my journey around the world, I have made deep connections, true meaningful intimate relationships with many walks of life. I know it\u2019s imperative to find someone who chooses us and acknowledges our many layers, who can be open and vulnerable, and most importantly, who is ready. To meet someone and be met. To be chosen and to choose. To love and to be loved. This is everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we need is that same energy reciprocated, and despite how open and loving you attempt to be, people can only meet you as deeply as they\u2019ve met themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to be the one that loved the most and give everything you had, because you\u2019ve got to find people who love like you do and who are ready. Out with the old, in with the TRUE. It was a long winter, and I\u2019m excited for a new season. Let the spring cleaning commence. I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\nUnglert, 26, also reflected on the split in his own Instagram post.\n\n\u201cGrowing up as a kid I had a crude but utopian idea of what love is,\u201d he said. \u201cI always had this idea that no matter what you did, no matter how you act, as long as you\u2019re true to yourself and act in good conscious, your path would lead you to the one person on this planet you\u2019re meant to be with. As I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve learned that although everyone DESERVES love, it\u2019s not something we\u2019re entitled to. Love takes work. Love is compromise. Love is earned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still have a lot of work to do on myself, a lot to prove to myself, before I\u2019m ready for something like that,\u201d he admitted.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?
