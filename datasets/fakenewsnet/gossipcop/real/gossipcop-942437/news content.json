The original three films were written by Ted Griffin and George Nolfi, along with Brian Koppelman and David Levien, for each respective film. Released from 2001 to 2007, the trilogy is often cited as defining its genre and leading to a proliferation and commercialization of heist films throughout the world.[1][2]\n\nBased on the 1960 Rat Pack film, Ocean's 11, the series has seen mixed to favorable critical reception and substantial commercial success. Collectively grossing US$1.17 billion worldwide, the most commercially successful rendition was the first, Ocean's Eleven (2001). It established the ensemble cast of George Clooney as Danny Ocean, Matt Damon as Linus Caldwell, and Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan. A long list of supporting cast members maintain the trilogy. The first sequel, Ocean's Twelve, was released in 2004 with the final film, Ocean's Thirteen, following in 2007. An all-female spin-off written and directed by Gary Ross titled Ocean's 8 was released on June 8, 2018.\n\nInspiration [ edit ]\n\nThe Ocean's film series was inspired by the 1960 heist film, Ocean's 11, directed by Lewis Milestone and starring five of the Rat Pack: Peter Lawford, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Joey Bishop.[3]\n\nOcean's trilogy [ edit ]\n\nOcean's Eleven (2001) [ edit ]\n\nMaster thief Danny Ocean (George Clooney), just out of prison, plans an elaborate Las Vegas three-casino-heist to win back his ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts). To that end, he recruits ten other thieves and con men to pull off the complex job, eventually stealing US$160 million.\n\nOcean's Twelve (2004) [ edit ]\n\nOcean's crew is blackmailed by the casino owner they stole from\u2014Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia)\u2014into paying him just over $198 million (their loot plus interest). The team is given two weeks to come up with the money so they travel to Europe to execute three heists.\n\nOcean's Thirteen (2007) [ edit ]\n\nOcean and his crew plan to rig a new casino's opening night to inflict ruinous losses after its ruthless owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) double crosses one of the gang, with plans to ruin his life.\n\nFuture [ edit ]\n\nAfter the release of Ocean's Thirteen, a sequel had been discussed until the death of Bernie Mac. However, on June 29, 2021, Don Cheadle revealed that Steven Soderbergh had been thinking of a way to do a sequel. On July 27, 2021, Matt Damon also commented on the idea of a sequel and stated that it would be up to Soderbergh and figuring out a story.[4][5]\n\nOcean's 8 (2018) [ edit ]\n\nSoderbergh and George Clooney initially downplayed the possibility of an Ocean's Fourteen or subsequent sequels after Bernie Mac's death in 2008.[6] However, a new Ocean's Eleven spin-off with an all-female cast led by Sandra Bullock as the sister of George Clooney's Danny Ocean was put in development. It was conceived by producer Jerry Weintraub, Soderbergh and Clooney. Olivia Milch wrote the screenplay, and Gary Ross directed the film.[7][8] Helena Bonham Carter, Cate Blanchett and Mindy Kaling were later announced to star in the film.[9] Elizabeth Banks had previously been attached to the project, but a deal between her and Warner Bros. could not be reached.[10]\n\nThe title of the spin-off was later revealed to be Ocean's Eight.[11] In August 2016, Anne Hathaway, Rihanna and Nora \"Awkwafina\" Lum were also confirmed to join the cast.[12] The night after her Emmy win, Sarah Paulson was announced as the final cast member of the titular eight.[13] The film was released in the United States on June 8, 2018.[14]\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nBox office performance [ edit ]\n\nCritical response [ edit ]", "images": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"], "top_img": "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean%27s_(film_series)", "title": "Ocean's (film series)", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.38.0-wmf.25", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"title": "Ocean's (film series) - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
