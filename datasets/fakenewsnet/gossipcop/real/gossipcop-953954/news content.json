Reynolds calls Hunt for the Wilderpeople \u201cone of the best movies you\u2019ll ever see.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re adding it to our list, ASAP.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2020%2F05%2F18%2FOlivia-Harvey-300x225-1.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F20%2Fsex-anxiety-tout.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F02%2F09%2FSwimsuits.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://hellogiggles.com/img/misc/300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F05%2F17%2Fboob-sweat.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Fyuliya-kosolapova-bqirdOGHvYQ-unsplash-e1573767747444.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1000&h=500&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F07%2F23%2FRyan-Raynolds-and-Blake-Lively-e1532354127862.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2021%2F07%2F08%2Fchiron-retrograde-2021.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F06%2F08%2Ffriendquestions-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fdream_about_ex.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1000&h=500&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F07%2F23%2FRyan-Raynolds-and-Blake-Lively-e1532354127862.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Olivia Harvey", "Updated Jul"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-favorite-show/", "title": "Ryan Reynolds Revealed His And Blake Lively's Current Favorite Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "blake lively,news,TRENDING,tv", "news_keywords": "blake lively,news,TRENDING,tv", "description": "During a panel discussion at San Diego's Comic-Con, Ryan Reynolds told fans what he and wife Blake Lively are currently bingeing, and honestly, us too.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Ryan Reynolds Revealed His And Blake Lively's Current Favorite Show", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-favorite-show/", "description": "During a panel discussion at San Diego's Comic-Con, Ryan Reynolds told fans what he and wife Blake Lively are currently bingeing, and honestly, us too.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1000&h=500&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F07%2F23%2FRyan-Raynolds-and-Blake-Lively-e1532354127862.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 500}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-favorite-show/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F07%2F23%2FRyan-Raynolds-and-Blake-Lively-e1532354127862.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-favorite-show/", "title": "Ryan Reynolds Revealed His And Blake Lively's Current Favorite Show", "description": "During a panel discussion at San Diego's Comic-Con, Ryan Reynolds told fans what he and wife Blake Lively are currently bingeing, and honestly, us too.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1000&h=500&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F13%2F2018%2F07%2F23%2FRyan-Raynolds-and-Blake-Lively-e1532354127862.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-favorite-show/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8Xvsjy57X0"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
