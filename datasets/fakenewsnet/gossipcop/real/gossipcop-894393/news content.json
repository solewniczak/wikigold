And it\u2019s a diamond!\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta - Season 10 Credit: Alex Martinez/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty\n\nWilliams, who was married to Stewart for two years before their divorce in 2013, may be rocking her old ring, but she\u2019s very much single. Earlier this month, she told PEOPLE that fans will see her dating on this season of the show \u2014 though it\u2019s just \u201cnot as much of a priority of mine as it\u2019s seemed in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cI absolutely know myself more today than I did when I was married\u201d she said when asked what she\u2019s looking for in a man. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s about finding someone who wants to be part of your world and who is supportive of you and who understands that if it ends up being a serious relationship, you\u2019ll make those adjustments to prioritize a happy family first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret anything because anything I\u2019ve been through just helps build who I am today \u2014 be it relationships with me or friendships, it all helps shape who you become. But I definitely say I\u2019m a different person, and I\u2019m supposed to be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Shere\u00e9 Whitfield On Kenya Moore Post-Wedding: \u2018She\u2019s Actually A Nicer Person Now!\u2019\n\nThe other major change for Williams is that she\u2019s cooled her jets on her quest for motherhood, something she attributes to time spent with her 1\u00bd-year-old niece Baleigh.\n\n\u201cEvery time I\u2019m around my niece, she gives me baby fever. But that\u2019s the thing about baby fever. You have it, and then you get well again,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m okay right now. I\u2019m not going to have a baby until I\u2019ve found that right guy. And I\u2019m sure once I find him, that\u2019ll be one of the first things we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019ve thought of a lot of creative ways I can make that happen without a man. Once I realized it doesn\u2019t have to be one way, then it gave me a little more time,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo I\u2019m not obsessing over it anymore.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F248515971_423792849226570_1672372709981615183_n.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fporsha-williams.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&url=undefined"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&url=undefined", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn", "November"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/porsha-williams-still-wears-wedding-ring/", "title": "Porsha Williams Still Wears Her Wedding Ring from Ex Kordell Stewart: 'It's Costume Jewelry'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "News,Porsha Williams,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of Atlanta", "news_keywords": "News,Porsha Williams,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of Atlanta", "description": "It's been four years, but the\u00a0Real Housewives of Atlanta\u00a0star is still wearing her wedding ring", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Porsha Williams Still Wears Her Wedding Ring from Ex Kordell Stewart: 'It's Costume Jewelry'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/porsha-williams-still-wears-wedding-ring/", "description": "It's been four years, but the\u00a0Real Housewives of Atlanta\u00a0star is still wearing her wedding ring", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&url=undefined"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/porsha-williams-still-wears-wedding-ring/", "media": "https://people.com/img/misc/og-default.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/porsha-williams-still-wears-wedding-ring/", "title": "Porsha Williams Still Wears Her Wedding Ring from Ex Kordell Stewart: 'It's Costume Jewelry'", "description": "It's been four years, but the\u00a0Real Housewives of Atlanta\u00a0star is still wearing her wedding ring", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&url=undefined"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/porsha-williams-still-wears-wedding-ring/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
