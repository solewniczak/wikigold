What was he morbidly musing about this time? Climate change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got sunshine in the west, the south, the east, and over here in the north, the ice caps are melting and I am so so so so scared,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t we fire you?\u201d host Jim Jefferies asked. They did. After making his debut as the weatherman in 2017, Pitt\u2019s character was later \u201cfired\u201d for being \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201ca real nutjob.\u201d\n\nThese memories started flooding back as he tried telling a joke involving basketball star LeBron James. \u201cI was hanging out with LeBron James, and he said, \u2018How\u2019s the weather down there?\u2019 because he\u2019s tall,\u201d he began. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Same as it is up there: changing at a pace not before seen in the history of man. Your legacy is pointless. Our people and our memories will all burn.'\u201d\n\nWatch Pitt\u2019s surprise cameo above.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F05%2Fbrad-pitt-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F04%2F09%2Fnick-romano-image.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F05%2Fbrad-pitt-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Romano", "May", "At Am Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/02/brad-pitt-weatherman-jim-jefferies-show/", "title": "Brad Pitt's depressing weatherman returns to The Jim Jefferies Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Brad Pitt,Comedy Central,Jim Jefferies,Last Night on Late Night", "news_keywords": "Brad Pitt,Comedy Central,Jim Jefferies,Last Night on Late Night", "description": "Climate change has this forecaster 'so so so so scared.'", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Brad Pitt's depressing weatherman returns to 'The Jim Jefferies Show'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/02/brad-pitt-weatherman-jim-jefferies-show/", "description": "Climate change has this forecaster 'so so so so scared.'", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F05%2Fbrad-pitt-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/02/brad-pitt-weatherman-jim-jefferies-show/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F05%2Fbrad-pitt-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/02/brad-pitt-weatherman-jim-jefferies-show/", "title": "Brad Pitt's depressing weatherman returns to 'The Jim Jefferies Show'", "description": "Climate change has this forecaster 'so so so so scared.'", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F05%2Fbrad-pitt-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/02/brad-pitt-weatherman-jim-jefferies-show/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/JwivtxQEmc8"], "publish_date": 1525212000.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
