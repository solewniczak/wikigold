The family is known for its strict adherence to the Baptist faith and conservative values, which include restrictions against any birth control methods. However, the Duggars have been criticized by those who believe that such large families are not healthy for children and those who oppose their anti-contraceptive activism.\n\nJim Bob Duggar was born on July 18, 1965, and Michelle Duggar was born on September 13, 1966. They married on July 21, 1984. Both of them are real estate agents, and Jim Bob Duggar served two terms as an Arkansas state legislator (from 1998 to 2003). The Duggars reside in Tontitown (Washington County) in northwestern Arkansas.\n\nThe Duggars have often explained why they chose to have a large family. Initially, Michelle used birth control pills, but between her first and second children, she became pregnant while on birth control, and the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. The couple felt that their use of birth control had caused them to lose the baby, and so they decided that they would no longer use it; in their words, they would \u201clet God decide how many children we would have.\u201d\n\nThere are nineteen children in the Duggar family. The oldest, Josh, was born in 1988. Twins Jana and John David were born in 1990, Jill in 1991, Jessa in 1992, Jinger in 1993, Joseph in 1995, Josiah in 1996, Joy Anna in 1997, twins Jedidiah and Jerimiah in 1998, Jason in 2000, James in 2001, Justin in 2002, Jackson in 2004, Johannah in 2005, Jennifer in 2007, Jordyn-Grace in 2008, and Josie in 2009.\n\nJim Bob Duggar ran for U.S. Senate in 2002. Although he lost the race, the Duggars credit the beginning of their celebrity to this event. A picture taken of the family at the polls appeared in the New York Times, which led to interviews and articles in Ladies\u2019 Home Journal and Parents Magazine, which in turn led to a documentary on Discovery Health Channel. The documentary was called 14 Kids and Pregnant Again! The Duggars agreed to take part in the project when they were promised that their faith would be highlighted.\n\nThe first episode of what was then called 17 Kids and Counting aired on September 29, 2008, on TLC and featured the family traveling to New York to appear on a talk show and announce Michelle\u2019s pregnancy with their eighteenth child. In 2014, the show 19 Kids and Counting entered its thirteenth season.\n\nThe oldest son in the family, Josh, married Anna Keller in September 2008, and they now have three children. Although they have moved to Washington DC, they still appear on 19 Kids and Counting. Another daughter, Jill, married Derik Dillard on June 21, 2014, and announced her first pregnancy in August that same year.\n\nThe Duggars do not watch television, and the children\u2019s Internet usage is closely monitored by the parents. The family is also known for following the tradition of courtship instead of dating. They involve prayers and hymns as part of their daily life, and they consider themselves Independent Baptists, which means that they do not belong to any specific branch of the Baptist faith.\n\nFamily members work as spokespeople with the Financial Freedom Seminar. They credit their financial stability to their ability to budget and save money, but they also rent out commercial properties for income, and their various public appearances generate income. It is estimated that the Duggars make at least $25,000 per episode of the show.\n\nBoth the show and the family have received criticism from the public. On their blog, Josh and Anna say, \u201cBeing in the public eye, people often disagree with our beliefs or the way we have chosen to live our lives. Our goal in life is to share of the hope that we have in Christ and to use whatever platform He has given us to do so.\u201d When asked if having a large family was harmful because of overpopulation, Michelle Duggar replied that she does not feel overpopulation is a problem.\n\nAnother controversy relates to the health of the children. The nineteenth child, Josie, was born prematurely and weighed only one pound and six ounces. Michelle was suffering from a rare complication of pregnancy in which her blood pressure was too high, and Josie had to be delivered via emergency C-section. In 2011, Michelle suffered a miscarriage but announced that she was still hoping to have more children. In 2014, Michelle and Jim Bob were shown on their TLC show visiting a Little Rock (Pulaski County) OB-GYN who specializes in high-risk pregnancies to investigate whether Michelle could have any more children.\n\nMichelle and Jim Bob Duggar have released two books: The Duggars: 20 and Counting! (2008) and A Love that Multiplies (2011). Four of the older daughters\u2014Jana, Jill, Jinger, and Jessica\u2014have released their own book, Growing Up Duggar: It\u2019s all about Relationships (2013), in which the sisters write about their relationship with God, family, friends, and significant others, as well as self-acceptance and the trials of adolescence.\n\nThe family is also politically active, having spoken out against pro-choice organizations such as Planned Parenthood. In the 2012 U.S. presidential race, they supported Republican candidate Rick Santorum. They filmed a short campaign video called 19 Reasons & Counting to Vote for Rick Santorum, in which they praised the candidate for his family values and conservative stance.\n\nFor additional information:\n\n\u201c\u201819 and Counting\u2019 Reveals Fun Facts about the Super-Sized Duggar Family.\u201d The Examiner, April 29, 2014. http://www.examiner.com/article/19-kids-and-counting-reveals-fun-facts-about-the-super-sized-duggar-family (accessed May 1, 2014).\n\nDuggar, Jana, Jill Duggar, Jessa Duggar, and Jinger Duggar.
