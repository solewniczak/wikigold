It was a space where he could explore new things, express himself and connect with the public on a deeper level: ''Before, I think I was more comfortable being \"the singer Kim Jonghyun.\" [...] Because it was the one I [and the public] was used to. However, that changed when I started doing radio. As I started expressing my human side to others, I became [more] comfortable with the image of Kim Jonghyun that I revealed through radio.'' He also enjoyed the routine that came with hosting the midnight radio show. It gave him a sense of stability, which is rare in the entertainment industry.[61]\n\nHe released his second compilation album, titled Story Op.2, on April 24, 2017.[62] Jonghyun held a series of 20 concerts, titled The Agit (The Letter), between May and July, 2017, at SMTOWN Coex Artium in Seoul.
