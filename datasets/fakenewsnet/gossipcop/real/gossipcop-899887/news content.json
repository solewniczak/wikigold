Despite being engaged to William, in 2010 Kate spent her last Christmas as a single woman with her own family. But, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn\u2019t have any family in the U.K. \u2014 and clearly Harry will have wanted his new fianc\u00e9e by his side.\n\nMembers Of The Royal Family Attend St Mary Magdalene Church In Sandringham Kate Middleton, Prince William, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at Christmas 2017 | Credit: Chris Jackson/Getty\n\nClaims have swirled about tension between brothers William and Harry and their wives, Kate and Meghan.
