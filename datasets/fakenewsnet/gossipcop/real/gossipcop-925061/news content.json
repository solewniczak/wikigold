Of course, Darcell didn\u2019t get partake.\n\nWe\u2019re told the pregnancy announcement was a huge success. Darcell\u2019s family wasn\u2019t at the show but she immediately texted them a video and they \u201cfreaked out,\u201d naturally.\n\nCongratulations \u2026 looks like someone already has a Godfather!", "images": ["https://theblast.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/7ac3e79f073bdf7c951e845f057d1202.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3&width=390", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/fb38a6d7ed322e1eaf3388b87365b769.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20156%2057'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MEGA824852_001-scaled-e1647379050408.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3&width=390", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/a4886c27d4b7067b259e63452ed9adfc.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/theblast-logo.png", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/8a4d471e9f3fcaa99276a05d6a50f42d.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3&width=390", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20331%2062'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/6973f51bba27d631a039818534cc4419.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/7ec21296caaebea9bdc3f50db139f56f.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/317d73e284de9af308c8b19c79900c6c.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3&width=390", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201300%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MEGA762883_011-1-scaled-e1647375916581.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/social_share.png", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MEGA771166_099-scaled-e1647356548536.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/temptation-island-logo.png", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/adf9e91eb8ee6f407aeb55d38dd9887b.jpg?aspect_ratio=13:6&width=1300&quality=75", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/c970819d5fe59756020637879ff15074.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mega835580_007-e1647370488182.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MEGA594780_042-scaled-e1646848649949.jpeg?aspect_ratio=4:3&width=390", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/2f16bf1c64a749976d3f914b71694063.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3&width=390", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/edf852fd8b528c3a20c0249c2d5ef3da.png?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180"], "top_img": "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/social_share.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Theblast Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/c/justin-timberlake-concert-fan-announce-pregnancy/", "title": "Justin Timberlake Stops Concert for Epic Pregnancy Announcement", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Timberlake Stops Concert for Epic Pregnancy Announcement", "description": "Justin Timberlake stopped his concert to help a lucky fan make one of the biggest announcements of her life.
