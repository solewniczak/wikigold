This week: Everyone still hates Eva, but they\u2019re also busy with WrestleMania too.\n\nWe get another glimpse into Natalya\u2019s relationship with her troubled dad, Jim Neidhart. This is an unusually serious subject for a lightweight television show?it feels a little jarring, but it\u2019s a good story to tell.\n\nNattie is looking forward to her dad being at WrestleMania when her mother comes around and breaks the news to her that he\u2019s gotten in trouble in rehab for throwing a temper tantrum and is getting kicked out. I didn\u2019t even know you could get kicked out of rehab. Nattie is heartbroken because he seemed to be doing so well. It\u2019s genuinely quite sad to see how the years of concern and stress in dealing with him have obviously taken their toll on both of them. Nattie really does seem like the parent when she deals with her dad.\n\nThen Nattie and TJ go to dinner With Bret Hart and his wife and he reminds her that her dad has to want sobriety for himself?and instead of freaking out over him all the time she has to try and focus on her life. This is actually great advice. Maybe Bret could start running his own advice column?\n\nLater Nattie and Jim have a father-daughter autograph session that goes surprisingly smoothly. I have to wonder if being around wrestling again is that good an idea for the man, since it seems obvious it has too many temptations.\n\nMeanwhile, Brie has a pregnancy scare when her period is two weeks late. She\u2019s sad because she genuinely thought she might be and is disappointed. She cries a lot, but thankfully, she has water-proof mascara. She wonders if she\u2019ll ever have a baby, and Nikki comforts her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a baby. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d I like the idea of a \u201cPsychic Nikki\u201d gimmick.\n\nBrie and Daniel have a fertility check. I don\u2019t know where this storyline is going. Maybe it turns out they do have problems and they have to ask Nikki to be a surrogate? Or perhaps they end up adopting some mysterious child from an orphanage who turns out to be a psycho killer and/or possessed by a demon? (Note to self: stop watching so many horror movies.)\n\nLater on, Brie takes her mind her mind off of her anxieties over motherhood by trashing Eva Marie again and saying how she doesn\u2019t \u201ccare about the business.\u201d She\u2019s training every day, what more do they want? For her to erect a shrine to Shawn Michaels in her living around that she prays to everyday while watching \u201990s Japanese wrestling tapes on a never-ending loop?\n\nBrian Kendrick encourages Eva to shake off the heat from the rest of the girls. He is great. Now I want a reality show where Bret and Brian just hang out all the time and act cool while occasionally giving sage advice to emotionally troubled wrestlers. And Paul London in a supporting role as the wacky neighbor.\n\nTrinity?one of the few sane divas on this show?correctly points out how unreasonable the women\u2019s hatred of Eva is and that they\u2019re all jealous. Whether or not they will pay any attention to her is another matter entirely. I really don\u2019t know what Eva is supposed to have done wrong here\u2026other than taking the same opportunities the other girls undoubtedly wish they\u2019d had.\n\nAlicia insists she\u2019s not jealous of Eva Marie.In the immortal words of Marsha Brady: \u201cSure, Jan.\u201d\n\nLater, Nikki suggests the bold strategy of talking to Eva calmly and civilly as a friend instead of verbally attacking and demeaning her constantly. Brie isn\u2019t too keen.\n\nAll through this, there\u2019s a subplot where Paige has to get a WrestleMania makeover, which means buying a gown and nice shoes because she doesn\u2019t own any?you know, because she\u2019s such a tomboy! Did we mention she\u2019s tomboy! Because she totally is!?and getting a tan. Paige is annoyed about the latter since she loves being pale. Doesn\u2019t she know it\u2019s the law in wrestling that everyone has to be orange? Blame Hogan. Regardless, she\u2019s not happy with the end results and ends up scrubbing the whole thing off. Later on, she meets her biggest fan. The fan calls her a role model and credits her for saving her life and helping cure her eating disorder by being herself. This makes Paige realize she\u2019s happier being her own person and doesn\u2019t want to be glamorous. Nice scene but it felt a bit contrived and scripted even by this show\u2019s standards. What, she just happened to bump into this fan who reminded her to be true to herself while getting a makeover she didn\u2019t really want? Hmmmm.\n\nNext week: WrestleMania gears up and the Bella twins get even more mad at Eva, if that\u2019s possible.\n\nHave a news tip or correction?
