The two got hitched in a gorgeous church; Meghan wore a Givenchy couture gown and stunningly embroidered veil for the vows; and Most Rev. Michael Curry, the Chicago bishop who delivered the ceremony's sermon, electrified the service like few there had seen before.\n\nBut, well, Prince Harry is still Prince Harry. And yes, we understand that our ginger-haired royal dreams have been, as of today, dashed\u2014but he still managed to steal our hearts today anyway (four times, to be precise).\n\nThat quick lip bite:\n\nWhen Harry first caught a glimpse of his bride walking down the aisle, we could pretty much all feel his heart rate spike. As Meghan finally approached the altar to stand beside him, Harry looked visibly moved. \"You look amazing,\" he whispered to her before quickly biting his lower lip. Meghan smiled and replied, \"Thank you.\" Ah, true love.\n\nAdmitting he could use a drink:\n\nWINDSOR, ENGLAND - MAY 19: (L-R) Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex leave Windsor Castle in the Ascot Landau carriage during a procession after getting married at St Georges Chapel on May 19, 2018 in Windsor, England.

Meghan let out a simple \"Wow\" at her first site of the crowds. Harry, however, was little bit more cheeky: According to the Telegraph, who consulted with lip reader Tina Lannin, he said to his bride: \"I'm ready for a drink now.\" That seems more than reasonable.\n\nHis reception toast:", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008d06be93432f8f357aa9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-960033980.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008d45903abc35e09fbf3d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-960128296.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008a9fd9d58036a7d004c6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-960174024.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b0088b3abb1f20ce3afda63/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-960109610.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Stacey Leasca"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/4-times-prince-harry-made-us-swoon-at-the-well-his-royal-wedding", "title": "4 Times Prince Harry Made Us Swoon at the (Well, His) Royal Wedding", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Prince Harry was as charming as ever during his wedding ceremony to Meghan Markle on Saturday at Windsor Castle.", "id": "5b007ea2d3a6f5317f1f4b5a", "keywords": "prince harry,royal wedding", "news_keywords": "prince harry,royal wedding", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b007ea2d3a6f5317f1f4b5a", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Prince Harry was as charming as ever during his wedding ceremony to Meghan Markle on Saturday at Windsor Castle.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Yes, yes, we KNOW he's off the market now.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "4 Times Prince Harry Made Us Swoon at the (Well, His) Royal Wedding", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/4-times-prince-harry-made-us-swoon-at-the-well-his-royal-wedding"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-05-19T22:15:07.916Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526768107.916, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
