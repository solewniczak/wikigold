I love the Marc Jacobs and Tom Fords, but I also love newer names. Nathalie also wanted to support Latino designers, as she\u2019s Peruvian and her character Cristal is Venezuelan. Johanna Ortiz and Juan Carlos Obando are in our lineup constantly, as are a couple of Mexican designers whose pieces we\u2019ll be using soon. Nathalie believes that Cristal would be the kind of person who would do that and I agree. She has money now and wants to give back and show that support.\u201d\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nFallon on the other hand is a reflection of the modern-day woman in Markworth-Pollack\u2019s eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s more outrageous,\u201d she stated of the revamped character, played by Elizabeth Gillies. \u201cHer colors have a little bit more of a punch and she\u2019s definitely more structured. But one thing I\u2019ve wanted to do with her is to not define her style to just one thing. She\u2019s really versatile and that\u2019s a total reflection of the modern woman. We can be one thing one day and someone else the next.\u201d Balmain, Saint Laurent, Alexandre Vauthier, and Marc Jacobs are on her style agenda for the season.\n\nFor Gillies, working on Dynasty has been a fashion education in the truest sense. \u201cI\u2019m learning about brands and the history of fashion and things that are coming back,\u201d she stated. \u201cWhen I go home now, I don\u2019t want anything in my closet! I\u2019m currently rebuilding it. And I used to go into stores that were mid-level and affordable and I\u2019d buy a lot. Now, I\u2019ll take that money and wait until high-end things go on sale. I\u2019m working on building a timeless closet now.\u201d But she acknowledges the fact that her character, Fallon wants to make a bold statement and turn heads wherever she goes. \u201cNo one who walks down the street in clothes like this will go unnoticed,\u201d Gillies confessed. \u201cYou\u2019ll get at least one \u2018slay\u2019 a day and it makes sense because she\u2019s killing it. It has made me want to take more risks for sure. I have a better eye and can pinpoint designers now: I was never able to do that before.\u201d\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAnd the guys have just as much fun with style as the ladies do. Though Sam Adegoke (who plays Jeff Colby) wasn\u2019t working on the day he visited the set, he showed up clad in a bold Paul Smith shirt. \u201cMy wardrobe is the most amazing on the show and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s even up for debate,\" he boasted. \"I recently went to Gucci for a custom look. A few different suits to the tune of like $50K. Jeff has some bright suits on.\" It was all about trusting Markworth-Pollack and her vision. \"Meredith said, 'Just trust me. I got you,'\" he divulged. \"It made me want to experiment more with color in my personal life. I do because I\u2019m from Nigeria, where our traditional West African clothing is very bright.\u201d\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAdegoke isn\u2019t the only guy in the cast who has fun with the wardrobe, as Rafael de la Fuente (formerly of Empire fame) has some of the boldest looks on the show with his character, Sammy Jo. \u201cWhen I read the character and was in the process of creating the character after I got the role, I for some reason thought of George Michael\u2019s aesthetic for the character,\u201d he revealed about the background behind his character\u2019s vibrant ensembles. \u201cI had been going through a '90s phase and [gravitated toward] that look: denim, leather jackets, and stuff. I\u2019m a huge George Michael fan, of course, but that link sort of just happened. I thought of his aesthetic for the character and I discussed it with Meredith.\u201d", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59fc85e152e9dc2ff73f6eca/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/TCDDYNA_EC025.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59fc8c9070ae4e37c2ec6434/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/TCDDYNA_EC022.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59fc8d1e545af946d5bbde0d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dynasty-fb.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59fc8d1e545af946d5bbde0d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dynasty-fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Faith Cummings"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/dynasty-cw-fashion-interview-cast-wardrobe-stylist", "title": "Dynasty Fashion: An Interview With the Cast and Wardrobe Stylist", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "In an exclusive interview with the cast and wardrobe stylists, Teen Vogue explores how the new CW show Dynasty is promoting diversity through fashion.", "id": "59f4ab4b2713a8783ea56707", "keywords": "dynasty,meredith markworth-pollack,the cw,elizabeth gillies,rafael de la fuente,nathalie kelly,sam adegoke", "news_keywords": "dynasty,meredith markworth-pollack,the cw,elizabeth gillies,rafael de la fuente,nathalie kelly,sam adegoke", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59f4ab4b2713a8783ea56707", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In an exclusive interview with the cast and wardrobe stylists, Teen Vogue explores how the new CW show Dynasty is promoting diversity through fashion.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59f4ac662713a8783ea56709/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/DYN101b_0175b.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59f4ac662713a8783ea56709/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/DYN101b_0175b.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "'Dynasty' is celebrating diversity through fashion.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59fc8d1e545af946d5bbde0d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dynasty-fb.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "The '80s Version of 'Gossip Girl' Is Back, and Making an Effort to Promote Designers of Color", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/dynasty-cw-fashion-interview-cast-wardrobe-stylist"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-11-03T15:40:34.663Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59fc8d1e545af946d5bbde0d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dynasty-fb.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509723634.663, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
