It\u2019s even more stunning than her engagement ring if that\u2019s possible,\u201d a source told PEOPLE at the time.\n\nThe ring is reported to be close to 20-carats, an upgrade from the 15-carat Lorraine Schwartz engagement ring Kanye famously proposed with at San Francisco\u2019s AT&T Park in 2013.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West Breaks Down Over Paris Robbery Attack: \u2018That Was So Meant to Happen to Me\u2019\n\nA source recently told PEOPLE that Kardashian West does not keep any expensive possessions in her new Hidden Hills, California, home.\n\n\u201cEver since the Paris robbery, Kim has made many changes in her life. She is much more careful about being flashy,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new year, with a new house and more changes,\u201d the source said. \u201cKim loves her new house. She wants to create the safest, best house for the kids. Along with their security team, Kim and Kanye have made plans to keep intruders out. Their new property is huge and requires even more 24/7 security staff. To keep the house safer, Kim doesn\u2019t want expensive possessions like jewelry at the house.\u201d\n\nThe source continued, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t wear expensive jewelry every day, so it makes no sense to keep it at the house.
