In the behind-the-scenes photograph, the mom of three was covered in grey plaster, but that was not enough to cover her nether region or her nipples, so she was forced to blur out her private parts.\n\n\u201cWe took a mold of my body and made it a perfume bottle,\u201d she captioned the revealing image.\n\nOn top of her upcoming KKW Fragrance launch, Kardashian West also teamed up with Lumee to design her own collection of Kimoji-covered cases, available now online.\n\n\u201cTo the media trying to demonize my husband let me just say this\u2026 your commentary on Kanye being erratic & his tweets being disturbing is actually scary.

Rather than just a simple business decision. So I\u2019m glad he tweeted about the state of his company and all of the exciting things happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a free thinker, is that not allowed in America?\u201d she added. \u201cBecause some of his ideas differ from yours you have to throw in the mental health card? That\u2019s just not fair. He\u2019s actually out of the sunken place when he\u2019s being himself which is very expressive.\u201d\n\nHarper's BAZAAR Celebrates \"ICONS By Carine Roitfeld\" Credit: Gilbert Carrasquillo/Getty\n\nLooking for more style content?
