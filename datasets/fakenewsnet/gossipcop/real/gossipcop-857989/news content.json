The book and movie were similar to the unique situation of \"starter wives\" like Justine Musk, the ex-wife of Elon Musk, as reported by Marie Claire. Wives who are in the club of first wives have unique issues, sometimes commiserating over being replaced for a \"younger model,\" with their ex-husbands supposedly \"upgrading\" as if to a McMansion. Now those women who the men have run to have their own little club, aptly named the Second Wives Club.\n\nOn E!, there's a new show displaying the Hollywood-based Second Wives Club, even if all of the women featured on Second Wives Club aren't really all wives, nor are they all \"second\" wives. Some of them are wife No. 3 or wife No. 5, not wife No. 2. With the brand new Second Wives Club series set to air on Thursday, May 4, at 9 p.m. ET/8 p.m. CT, the following preview videos have been released, giving a snippet of what to expect.\n\nAlthough some of the women featured in the Second Wives Club reality TV show might have plenty of material items, or at least pretend they do, the mansions, haute couture wardrobes, champagne fridges inside of luxury cars and more don't mean they are all leading happy lives, as seen in the below E! trailer for the Second Wives Club released recently.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a18db45c9405ae51d93642e54fd02be?s=800", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/danica-patrick-2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e9d08fc1-90e7-44a0-a337-ec07b6d582ac.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nicole-scherzinger-2.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/7d29454b-301e-4088-86fa-3aff1cf25b9e.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Mandy-Rose-3.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/9e1eeba9-a8c9-4dbf-bf8e-15ed56ed5931.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4117935/second-wives-club-e-reality-show-sued-by-husband-claiming-fakery-hollywood-cast-premieres-may-4-video/", "title": "'Second Wives Club' E!
