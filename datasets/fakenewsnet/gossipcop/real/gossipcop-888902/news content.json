Before that began, Lillian Garcia (who moderated) spoke to the Bellas about turning on WWE Raw Women\u2019s Champion Ronda Rousey, which has now led to Nikki receiving a title shot at WWE Evolution on October 28. Nikki also noted that she wanted the current title added to her resume, something beyond her reign as Divas Champion.\n\n\u201cI guess that was the only way to get my match,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cI had to turn on her, she\u2019s the champ. I\u2019ve been here for 12 years, she hasn\u2019t, so I have to teach her a lesson. \u2026 I need to have a reign that [goes beyond] the Divas Championship, so I\u2019m not always called a diva and then one day I can actually be called a Raw Women\u2019s Champion. I got red in my eyes, I\u2019m looking for that championship.\u201d\n\nGarcia then asked if it was strange for WWE to refer to everyone as WWE Superstars, yet they are still on E!\u2019s show, Total Divas. Nikki said that she has tried to change the show\u2019s name, but it\u2019s not that easy.\n\n\u201cBeing an Executive Producer of Total Divas, we\u2019ve had so many discussions about changing the name of the show,\u201d Nikki responded. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s on network TV and you can\u2019t just change the name one day. They have felt people will still be connected with it ? even though it\u2019s called Total Divas ? I feel the opposite. I feel there\u2019s a huge disconnect because we\u2019ve made that name so bad.\u201d\n\nNikki continued by going back a bit to when the Divas Championship \u2013 aka the \u201cButterfly Championship\u201d \u2013 was created for the women\u2019s division in 2008. While cool for the division, she said it wasn\u2019t what the women were \u201ccraving.\u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve me, us girls in the past, I remember when they brought out the \u2018Butterfly Championship,'\u201d Nikki continued. \u201cWe were like \u2018oh!\u2019 we weren\u2019t expecting it. It\u2019s totally cute, but that wasn\u2019t what the women were craving, they were craving what [the title] is now.\u201d\n\nYou can see the full Q&A in the video below.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit ACE Comic Con with an H/T to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nHave a news tip or correction?
