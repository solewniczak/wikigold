Lucas Jackson / Reuters\n\nThe year is 1993. Bill Clinton is president, Nirvana is one of the biggest bands in the world and high schooler Bradley Cooper is a senior at Pennsylvania\u2019s Germantown Academy, writing a steamy editorial about hooking up with his best friend.\n\nTommy Rowan, a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer, uncovered Cooper\u2019s first piece for The Philadelphia Daily News and tweeted it out on Tuesday. The headline, \u201cWhen best friends cross the line,\u201d says it all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowan tweeted a photo of the article, and a larger version can be seen here. He also confirmed its authenticity in an email to HuffPost.\n\nIntern Bradley Cooper, age 18, wrote in his first @PhillyDailyNews story: \"Can best friends who are of the opposite sex hook up with each other without destroying their friendship? In my case, yes . . . so far.\" Bold. pic.twitter.com/DDyKIFtNqM \u2014 tommy rowan (@tommyrowan) January 23, 2018\n\nAccording to Rowan, Cooper wrote the piece as an 18-year-old intern at the newspaper. He quoted Cooper\u2019s introductory paragraph, \u201cCan best friends who are of the opposite sex hook up with each other without destroying their friendship? In my case, yes . . . so far.\u201d\n\nThe reporter called that declaration \u201cbold.\u201d\n\n\u201cBold\u201d is one of many words that can be used to describe Cooper\u2019s piece. The article goes on to talk about the progression of his relationship with his \u201cbest friend,\u201d Deborah Landes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know once you take that step over the platonic line everything is supposed to change,\u201d Cooper wrote. \u201cSuddenly you start to hate that guy she always told you was hot. But that\u2019s not really true in my case.\u201d\n\nHis article also includes such gems as:\n\nThere has always been an underlying attraction between the two of us; however, it was never confronted until this year. Before, we could never fathom the idea of being more than just friends, especially because she was involved in a relationship with a friend of mine. After they broke up, things began to change.\n\nThis sweet bit about prom:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe never even thought twice about going to the prom with anyone else.\n\nAnd a reference to the sun setting on their relationship once summer begins:\n\nIt is somewhat easy to say everything is cool now, because we are still in school. The real test will probably come when I have to hear about how much fun she\u2019s having at the shore this summer.\n\nJust for fun, here\u2019s another photo of Cooper from his high school days:\n\n#BradleyCooper's yearbook photo from the @GA1759 Germantown Academy yearbook of which I was Editor in 1990. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/yN9QwhypjT \u2014 Michael MPH (@PhillyPartTwo) February 25, 2013\n\nNeedless to say, people had a lot of thoughts about the article after Rowan tweeted it out.\n\nSo did it work out for them ? Are they still friends? Did he become a journalist? We demand to know ! \u2014 PM (@pmnycphd) January 23, 2018\n\nHer dad must have loved that article. As well as his buddies at the mill. \u2014 Chip Kelly's Ego (@GeneHart4Ever) January 23, 2018\n\nChange the title to \"Area teens add benefits to friendship\" and you've got yourself an Onion article \u2014 JamieT (@JamieTre) January 23, 2018\n\nThis newspaper publishes op eds about teenagers fucking each other? \u2014 Jemele Trill (@DorothyBornblaq) January 24, 2018\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say we all know what happened to Cooper after the article\u2019s publication. He went to Villanova University for a year, graduated from Georgetown University with a degree in English, picked up some French at some point and ultimately became an A-list actor. He\u2019s now in a relationship with model Irina Shayk and the two have one child, a daughter born in 2017.", "images":
