She was my first child, my companion and my friend. She was incredible! She made sure I was never lonely even during lonely times. The house will never be the same. I never thought I would be this devastated over loosing [sic] a dog but 14 years, is a long time together. She filled a significant role in my life and I\u2019m forever grateful. I love you Goober!! I\u2019ll remember you always!\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up post on her app on Wednesday, Kardashian recalled more fond memories of the pup. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I wanted to be a vet when I grew up, and had this insane plan to drive around in an RV and pick up stray animals, LOL,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo when my mom and Bruce separated, I was immediately like, \u2018Let me take Gabbana!\u2019 She was the family dog, and since Kendall and Kylie both moved out, I thought Gabbana was lonely. I wanted her to have a fun home again!!!\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9\u2019s sister, Kendall Jenner, 22, also posted a goodbye to Gabbana via Instagram on Tuesday, expressing her love and condolences.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss your kisses forever Gooby,\u201d wrote Kendall. \u201cI know you\u2019re up there swimming, little fishy.\u201d\n\nThe girls\u2019 beloved pet has been part of the family for a long time and was known for her love of swimming and Pup-Peroni, Kardashian said. \u201cShe is so well-trained and super smart. Sometimes Gabbana can be a little overly friendly, LOL. When people come to the house, she\u2019ll just go right up to them and start licking.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fkhloe-kardashian-dog-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fkhloe-kardashian-dog-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Saryn Chorney", "January"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/pets/khloe-kardashian-dog-dies-gabbana/", "title": "Two Months Before Her Due Date, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Mourns the Death of Her Dog Gabbana", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Celeb Pets,Khlo&eacute; Kardashian,News,Pet Deaths", "news_keywords": "Celeb Pets,Khlo&eacute; Kardashian,News,Pet Deaths", "description": "The Labrador retriever was 14 years old", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Two Months Before Her Due Date, Khlo&eacute; Kardashian Mourns the Death of Her Dog Gabbana", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/pets/khloe-kardashian-dog-dies-gabbana/", "description": "The Labrador retriever was 14 years old", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fkhloe-kardashian-dog-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/pets/khloe-kardashian-dog-dies-gabbana/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fkhloe-kardashian-dog-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/pets/khloe-kardashian-dog-dies-gabbana/", "title": "Two Months Before Her Due Date, Khlo&eacute; Kardashian Mourns the Death of Her Dog Gabbana", "description": "The Labrador retriever was 14 years old", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fkhloe-kardashian-dog-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/pets/khloe-kardashian-dog-dies-gabbana/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
