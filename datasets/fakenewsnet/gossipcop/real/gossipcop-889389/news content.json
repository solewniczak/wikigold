Sadly, we do still have to wait a little bit, but to ease the sting of delayed gratification, we have a juicy sneak peek of what to expect in the upcoming season. Ladies and gentlemen, the taglines are here!\n\nPeep the video above to hear the deliciously sassy lines that each member of the Season 9 cast will use to introduce herself. And don't worry, the women are as tough and fierce as ever. Need proof?\n\n\"I can make you laugh or make you cry. Your choice!\" Margaret Josephs trills in her tagline. Melissa Gorga proves she's not taking any you-know-what this season with her one-liner: \"Don't try to bully me, because I'm a boss.\" Rookie Jackie Goldschneider is keeping count with her witty tagline: \"I have four kids, two degrees, and one kickass life.\" Dolores Catania shows her softer side with her statement: \"I may put up a tough front, but I'll never leave you behind,\" while the other newcomer Jennifer Aydin shares her interests in a most succinct manner. \"I'm obsessed with family, traditions, and Chanel.\"\n\nAnd, as Zen as ever, Teresa Giudice has this to say: \"These days, I don't throw punches. I roll with them.\"\n\nYes, ladies, yes! And for more Jersey, check out a season preview below. Make sure to tune in to RHONJ when it premieres on November 7 at 9/8c.\n\n", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/02/rhonj-aftershow.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/03/daily-dish-bdsy-colin-macrae-chef-marcos-spaziani.jpeg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/03/daily-dish-ig-summer-house-vpr-tom-sandoval-lindsay-carl.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/02/daily-dish-rhoc-aftershow.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/10/dish-teresa-gia-giudice.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/faux_player__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/544/327/180919_3797902_Your_First_Look_at__RHONJ_Season_9_.jpg?itok=X41wSixg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/03/daily-dish-lck-top-chef-season-19.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/03/daily-dish-ig-family-karma-mtm-anila-sajja-anisha-ramakrishna.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/03/daily-dish-summer-house-lindsay-hubbard-austen-kroll.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--mobile/public/2021/12/rhonj-season-12-16x9-no-logo.jpg?itok=ZS2b8vpa", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020/08/bravo-insider-content-schedule_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/heartlock-white.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/10/personal-space-rhonj-college.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/10/dish-rhonj-taglines.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/03/daily-dish-bdsy-daisy-kelliher-gary-king.jpeg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2021/11/daily-dish-rhoslc-aftershow-editors-pick.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/faux_player__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/536/194/181022_3816506_The_RHONJ_Season_9_Taglines_Are_Here_.jpg?itok=7L9LwRTu"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/10/dish-rhonj-taglines.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-season-9-taglines-revealed", "title": "Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 9 Taglines Revealed", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1142922, "parsely-section": "The Daily Dish Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"Get a Sneak Peek of The RHONJ Season 9 Taglines\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"The Daily Dish\"},\"field_tv_shows\":\"The Real Housewives of New Jersey\",\"field_microsite\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1075801\",\"site_section\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/10\\/dish-rhonj-taglines.jpg?itok=wUwcrObH\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/10\\/dish-rhonj-taglines.jpg?itok=PgCRte6V\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/10\\/dish-rhonj-taglines.jpg?itok=fVCxk-NW\"}}", "fb": {"app_id": 1592250694320227}, "og": {"site_name": "Bravo TV Official Site", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey-season-9-taglines-revealed", "title": "The Real Housewives of New Jersey Are as Tough as Ever: Get a Sneak Peek of Their Sassy Taglines | Bravo TV Official Site", "description": "The Real Housewives of New Jersey\u00a0\u00a0Season 9 is almost here \u2014 and we can hardly wait to put out our best sprinkle cookies and host a Jersey-style viewing party.
