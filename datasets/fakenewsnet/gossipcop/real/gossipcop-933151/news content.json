The frequent costars posed together on the red carpet at the annual event.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nWoodley, 26, channeled the \u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\u201d theme in a futuristic silver Ralph Lauren dress with white ruffle details on the sleeves. She paired her look with black thigh-high boots.\n\nMeanwhile, Elgort kept his look classic in a Ralph Lauren tux.\n\nElgort and Woodley famously starred together in the Divergent series, playing brother and sister in a dystopian society. And of course, they later went on to star as love-interest in the highly-successful film The Fault in Our Stars.\n\nHeavenly Bodies: Fashion & The Catholic Imagination Costume Institute Gala Ansel

something really beautiful about working with someone again, and again, and again because the more you get to know somebody on a personal level the more free you feel artistically,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that if Ansel and I hadn\u2019t known each other from Divergent, our relationship in this movie would not be what it is.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Shailene Woodley Makes Her Relationship

longer.\n\nAfter the last film in the Divergent series, Allegiant, failed to bring in money at the box office, Lionsgate decided to turn the final installment, Ascendant, into a TV movie.", "images":
