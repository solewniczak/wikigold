For other uses, see Bieber (disambiguation)\n\nJustin Drew Bieber ( ; born March 1, 1994) is a Canadian singer. He was discovered by American record executive Scooter Braun and signed with RBMG Records in 2008, gaining recognition with the release of his debut seven-track EP My World (2009) and soon establishing himself as a teen idol.\n\nBieber achieved commercial success with his teen pop-driven debut studio album, My World 2.0 (2010), which debuted atop the US Billboard 200, making him the youngest solo male act to top the chart in 47 years.[3] The album also contained the internationally successful single \"Baby\", which became one of the highest certified singles of all time in the US.[4] His second studio album, Under the Mistletoe (2011), became the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut at number one in the US.[5] Bieber experimented with dance-pop in his third studio album, Believe (2012).[6] In 2013, Bieber became the first and youngest act in history to have five US number-one albums at the age of 18.[7] Between 2013 and 2014, Bieber was involved in multiple controversies and legal issues, which had a drastic impact on his public image.[8]\n\nIn 2015, Bieber released \"Where Are \u00dc Now\" in collaboration with Jack \u00dc, which saw Bieber explore EDM[9] and win the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Recording.[10] The song's musical direction played an instrumental role in his fourth studio album, Purpose, which produced three US number-one singles: \"Love Yourself\", \"Sorry\", and \"What Do You Mean?\". He became the first artist in history to occupy the entire top three of the UK Singles Chart.[11] Bieber diversified on numerous collaborations between 2016 and 2017 including DJ Khaled's \"I'm the One\", which reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. A week later, he released his remix to Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's \"Despacito\", his second consecutive US chart-topper. The song tied the then-record for most weeks atop the US Billboard Hot 100 and made Bieber the first artist in history to chart new number-one singles in consecutive weeks.[12] \"Despacito\" was ranked number one on Billboard's Greatest of All Time Hot Latin Songs Chart[13] and earned Bieber his career-first Latin Grammy Award for Best Urban Fusion/Performance.[14] In 2019, he released a country collaboration with Dan + Shay, \"10,000 Hours\", which won the Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance.[15]\n\nIn 2020, Bieber released his R&B-led fifth studio album, Changes, which debuted at number one in both the UK and US, and a standalone duet with Ariana Grande, \"Stuck with U\", which debuted atop the US Billboard Hot 100.[16] Bieber returned to his pop roots on his sixth studio album, Justice (2021), which debuted atop the US Billboard 200, making him the youngest soloist to have eight US number-one albums, a record held previously by Elvis Presley since 1965.[17] It produced the number-one single \"Peaches\" and became a commercial success. In July 2021, Bieber released a collaboration with the Kid Laroi, \"Stay\", which became his eighth number-one single in the US.[18]\n\nBieber is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 150 million records worldwide. He is credited with three Diamond certifications from the RIAA for \"Baby\", \"Sorry\" and \"Despacito\". He has received numerous accolades, including two Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, two Brit Awards, one Bambi Award, 21 Billboard Music Awards, 18 American Music Awards, 21 MTV Europe Music Awards (the most wins for any artist), six MTV Video Music Awards, 23 Teen Choice Awards (the most wins for a male individual), and 32 Guinness World Records. Time named Bieber one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and he was included on Forbes' list of the top ten most powerful celebrities in 2011, 2012, and 2013.[19]\n\nEarly life\n\nBieber was born on March 1, 1994, at St Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario,[20] and was raised in Stratford, Ontario.[21] He is the son of Jeremy Jack Bieber and Pattie Mallette, who were never married.[22] Mallette's mother Diane and stepfather Bruce helped her raise her son.[23] Bieber's ancestry includes French-Canadian, Irish, English, Scottish, and German.[25][26]\n\nThrough his father, Jeremy, Bieber has three younger half-siblings. Jeremy and his ex-wife, Erin Wagner,[27] who broke up in 2014 after seven years together, have two children, daughter Jazmyn and son Jaxon.[28] Jeremy married his girlfriend Chelsey in February 2018, and they have a daughter named Bay.[29][30] Bieber also has a stepsister named Allie, the daughter of his stepmother.[31] Pattie worked a series of low-paying office jobs, raising Bieber as a single mother in low-income housing. Bieber has maintained contact with his father.[32]\n\nBieber attended a French-language immersion elementary school in Stratford, the Jeanne Sauv\u00e9 Catholic School.[23] He graduated from high school in Stratford, Ontario, the St. Michael Catholic Secondary School, in 2012[33] with a 4.0 GPA.[34] Growing up, he learned to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet.[21][35] In early 2007, aged 12, Bieber sang Ne-Yo's \"So Sick\" for a local singing competition in Stratford and was placed second.[35][36] Mallette posted a video of the performance on YouTube for their family and friends to see. She continued to upload videos of Bieber singing covers of various R&B songs, and Bieber's popularity on the site grew.[37] In the same year, Bieber busked shows in front of Avon Theatre steps with a rented guitar during tourism season.[38]\n\nCareer\n\n2008\u20132009: Career beginnings and My World\n\nBieber at a signing event in 2009\n\nWhile searching for videos of a different singer, Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def Recordings, clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 YouTube videos by accident.[32] Impressed, Braun tracked down the theatre Bieber was performing at, located Bieber's school, and finally contacted his mother Mallette, who was initially reluctant because of Braun's Judaism. She remembered praying, \"God, I gave him to you. You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!\", and, \"God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?\" However, church elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun. At age 13, Bieber went to Atlanta, Georgia, with Braun to record demo tapes.[32] Bieber began singing for Usher one week later.[39]\n\nBieber was soon signed to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture between Braun and Usher.[40] Justin Timberlake was reportedly also in the running to sign Bieber but lost the bidding war to Usher, partly due to the idea that two associated Justins would confuse the market.[40][41]\n\nUsher then sought assistance in finding a label home for the artist from then manager Chris Hicks, who helped engineer an audition with his contact L.A. Reid of The Island Def Jam Music Group.[42] Reid signed Bieber to Island Records in October 2008 (resulting in a joint venture between RBMG and Island Records) and appointed Hicks as executive vice-president of Def Jam, where he could manage Bieber's career at the label.[43][37][40][42] Bieber then moved to Atlanta with his mother to pursue further work with Braun and Usher.[40] Braun became Bieber's manager in 2008.[37]\n\nBieber's first single, \"One Time\", was released to radio while Bieber was still recording his debut album.[44] The song reached number 12 on the Canadian Hot 100 during its first week of release in July 2009,[37] and peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. During fall 2009, it had success in international markets.[45] The song was certified platinum in Canada and the US and gold in Australia and New Zealand.[46][47][48] His first release, an extended play titled My World, was released on November 17, 2009. The album's second single, \"One Less Lonely Girl\", and two promotional singles, \"Love Me\" and \"Favorite Girl\", were released exclusively on the iTunes Store and charted within the top 40 of the US Billboard Hot 100.[45] As a result, he became the first solo artist to have four singles chart in the top 40 of the Hot 100 before the release of a debut album.[49]\n\n\"One Less Lonely Girl\" was later also released to radio and peaked within the top 20 in Canada and the US, and was certified gold in the latter.[45] Following the release of My World, Bieber became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut album chart on the Billboard Hot 100.[50] My World was eventually certified platinum in the US and double platinum in both Canada and the United Kingdom.[51][52][53] To promote the album, Bieber performed on several live shows such as mtvU's VMA 09 Tour, European program The Dome, YTV's The Next Star, The Today Show,[54][55] The Wendy Williams Show, Lopez Tonight, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, It's On with Alexa Chung, Good Morning America, Chelsea Lately, and BET's 106 & Park. Bieber also guest starred in an episode of True Jackson, VP in late 2009.[56]\n\nBieber performed Ron Miller and Bryan Wells's \"Someday at Christmas\" for former US President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama at the White House for Christmas in Washington, which aired on December 20, 2009, on US television broadcaster TNT.[57] Bieber was also one of the performers for Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest, on December 31, 2009.[58]\n\n2010\u20132011: My World 2.0, Never Say Never, and Under the Mistletoe\n\nBieber was a presenter at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards on January 31, 2010. He was invited to be a vocalist for the remake of the charity single \"We Are the World\" for its 25th anniversary to benefit Haiti after the earthquake. Bieber sings the opening line, which was sung by Lionel Richie in the original version.[59]\n\nOn March 12, 2010, a version of K'naan's \"Wavin' Flag\", recorded by a collective of Canadian musicians known as Young Artists for Haiti, was released. Bieber is featured in the song, performing the closing lines.\n\nIn January 2010, \"Baby\" was released from his debut album My World 2.0. The song featured Ludacris, and became an international hit. It charted at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaked at number three on the Canadian Hot 100[61] and reached the top ten in several international markets.[45] Two promo singles, \"Never Let You Go\" and \"U Smile\", were top 30 hits on the US Hot 100, and top 20 hits in Canada.[45] According to review aggregator Metacritic, the album has received generally favourable reviews.[62] It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, making Bieber the youngest solo male act to top the chart since Stevie Wonder in 1963.[3] My World 2.0 also debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, Irish Albums Chart, Australian Albums Chart, and the New Zealand Albums Chart[45] and reached the top 10 of fifteen other countries.[63][64]\n\nTo promote the album, Bieber appeared on several live programs including The View, the 2010 Kids' Choice Awards, Nightline, Late Show with David Letterman, The Dome and 106 & Park.[65] Sean Kingston appeared on the album's next single \"Eenie Meenie\". The song reached the top ten in the United Kingdom and Australia, and the top 20 of most other markets. On April 10, 2010, Bieber was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live.[66] On July 4, 2010, Bieber performed at the Macy's Fourth of July Fireworks Spectacular in New York City.[67] The following single from My World 2.0, \"Somebody to Love\", was released in April 2010, and a remix was released featuring Bieber's mentor Usher. On June 23, 2010, Bieber went on his first official headlining tour, the My World Tour, starting in Hartford, Connecticut, to promote My World and My World 2.0. In May 2010, Bieber featured in Soulja Boy's song \"Rich Girl\".[68] In July 2010, it was reported that Bieber was the most searched-for celebrity on the Internet.[69] That same month, his music video for \"Baby\" surpassed Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" (2009) as the most viewed, and also the most disliked, YouTube video at the time.[70][71] In September 2010, it was reported that Bieber accounted for 3% of all traffic on Twitter, according to an employee of the social-networking site.[72]\n\nOn My World 2.0, Bieber's voice was noted to be deeper than it was in his debut EP, due to puberty.[73] In April 2010, the singer remarked regarding his vocals: \"It cracks. Like every teenage boy, I'm dealing with it and I have the best vocal coach in the world ... Some of the notes I hit on \"Baby\" I can't hit any more. We have to lower the key when I sing live.\"[74] Bieber guest-starred in the season premiere of the CBS American crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which aired on September 23, 2010. He played a \"troubled teen who is faced with a difficult decision regarding his only brother\", who is also a serial bomber. Bieber was also in a subsequent episode of the series, which aired on February 17, 2011, in which his character is killed.[75] Bieber performed a medley of his singles \"U Smile\", \"Baby\", and \"Somebody to Love\", and briefly played the drums, at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.[76] Bieber announced in October 2010 that he would be releasing an acoustic album, called My Worlds Acoustic.[77] It was released on November 26, 2010, in the United States and featured acoustic versions of songs from his previous albums, and accompanied the release of a new song titled \"Pray\".[78]\n\nA 3-D part-biopic, part-concert film starring Bieber entitled Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, was released on February 11, 2011, directed by Step Up 3D director Jon M. Chu. It topped the box office with an estimated gross of $12.4 million on its opening day from 3,105 theatres.[79] It grossed $30.3 million for the weekend and was narrowly beaten by the romantic comedy Just Go with It, which grossed $31 million.[80] Never Say Never reportedly exceeded industry expectations, nearly matching the $31.1 million grossed by Miley Cyrus's 2008 3-D concert film, Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert, which holds the record for the top debut for a music-documentary.[81] Never Say Never grossed a total of $98,441,954 worldwide.[82] The film is accompanied by his second remix album, Never Say Never \u2013 The Remixes, released February 14, 2011, and features remixes of songs from his debut album, with guest appearances from Miley Cyrus, Chris Brown, and Kanye West, among others.[83] One song from the album, \"That Should Be Me\", featuring country music band Rascal Flatts, won him his first award in country music for Collaborative Video of the Year at the CMT Music Awards in June 2011. Time magazine named Bieber one of the 100 most influential people in the world on their annual list.[84] In June 2011, Bieber was ranked No. 2 on the Forbes list of Best-Paid Celebrities under 30. He is the youngest star, and 1 of 7 musicians on the list, having raked in $53 million in a 12-month period.[85] The same month, his collaborative single \"Next to You\" with American singer Chris Brown has released. The unfinished video for that song was leaked online on June 6, and the official video was released on June 17.\n\nOn November 1, 2011, Bieber released the Christmas-themed Under the Mistletoe, his second studio album.[86] It became the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and sold 210,000 copies in its first week of release.[87] On November 19, 2021, the album was listed among the Greatest of All Time Top Holiday Albums chart by Billboard.[88] The first single from the album, \"Mistletoe\" peaked at number one on the US Billboard Holiday 100 and Holiday Digital Songs charts.[89] Bieber released \"All I Want for Christmas Is You (SuperFestive!)\" as the second single from the album, which is a re-recorded version of Mariah Carey's original single \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" with Carey providing vocals on the track.[90] On November 19, 2021, the singles were listed among the Greatest of All Time Holiday 100 Songs chart by Billboard.[91]\n\n2012\u20132014: Believe, Journals, and other appearances\n\nIn late 2011, Bieber began recording his third studio album, titled Believe.[92] The following week, Bieber appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to announce that the first single would be called \"Boyfriend\", and was released on March 26, 2012.[93] The song debuted at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, selling a total of 521,000 digital units, the second-highest-ever debut digital sales week.[94] Bill Werde of Billboard noted that it failed to debut at number one because the digital download of the track was available only through the iTunes Store, \"restricting the buying option for those [who] do not frequent the Apple retail store\".[95] \"Boyfriend\" became Bieber's first single ever to reach the top position on the Canadian Hot 100 by debuting at number one and staying on for one week.[94] Bieber was featured on American hip hop group Far East Movement's song \"Live My Life\", from their fourth studio album Dirty Bass, in February 2012. The song emerged online five days before its scheduled release date and peaked within the top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100.[96] The first promotional single from the album, \"Die in Your Arms\", was released on May 29, 2012, and the second promotional single, \"All Around the World\" featuring American rapper Ludacris, followed the next week.[97][98] The second single from Believe, \"As Long as You Love Me\" featuring rapper Big Sean, was released on June 11, 2012. It peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100.[99]\n\nBieber performing during his Believe Tour in October 2012\n\nHis third studio album, Believe, was released on June 19, 2012, by Island Records. The album marked a musical departure from the teen pop sound of his previous releases, and incorporated elements of dance-pop and R&B genres.[100] Intent on developing a more \"mature\" sound, Bieber collaborated with a wide range of urban producers for the release as well as some long-time collaborators, including Darkchild, Hit-Boy, Diplo, and Max Martin. Entertainment Weekly praised Bieber's musical shift, calling the album both a \"reinvention and a reintroduction\".[101] Rolling Stone noted the deeper voice and more \"intense\" beats found on the album, although it lampooned one of his euphemisms for newfound sexual maturity (\"If you spread your wings, you can fly away with me\").[102] Believe debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming his fourth number-one album.[103][104][105] The album sold 57,000 copies in its first week in Canada, debuting atop the Canadian Albums Chart.[106] In September 2012, Bieber was featured on \"Beautiful\", a song from Carly Rae Jepsen's second studio album, Kiss (2012).[107] In October 2012, the third single from Believe, \"Beauty and a Beat\" featuring rapper Nicki Minaj, was released.

His appearance was panned by critics[111][112] and cast members, including Kate McKinnon, who said Bieber was not comfortable with his hosting duties, and Bill Hader, who said he did not enjoy the presence of Bieber or his entourage. Hader added that in his eight years on the television program, Bieber was the only host who lived up to his reputation.[113][114]\n\nOn March 7, 2013, Bieber fainted backstage at London's O2 Arena after complaining of breathing problems throughout his concert performance and was taken to the hospital.[115] Bieber cancelled his second Lisbon, Portugal concert at the Pavilh\u00e3o Atl\u00e2ntico, which was to be held on March 12, because of low ticket sales. The concert held in the same venue on March 11 did go on as scheduled.[116] In mid-August 2013, a remixed duet version of Michael Jackson's previously unreleased song \"Slave to the Rhythm\", featuring Bieber, leaked online.[117] In response to criticism over this remix, the Michael Jackson Estate stated that it had not authorized the release of this recording, and has since made attempts to remove the song from as many web sites and YouTube channels as possible.[118] Later, a song titled \"Twerk\" by rapper Lil Twist, featuring Bieber as well as Miley Cyrus, also leaked.[119] In September, Bieber was featured in Maejor Ali's song \"Lolly\" with rapper Juicy J.[120] A music video for \"Melodies\", the debut single of American singer Madison Beer, was released in the same month featuring Bieber in a cameo appearance.[121]\n\nOn October 3, 2013, Bieber announced that he would release a new song every Monday for 10 weeks as a lead-up to the film Justin Bieber's Believe, which entered production in May 2012 and was released on December 25, 2013.

During the visit, Bieber committed to provide buses to transport relatives of the inmates who have been unable to see them due to the COVID-19 pandemic in California.[356] Bieber described his visit to the prison as a \"life-changing experience that I will never forget\".[357]\n\nLegal issues and controversies\n\nBieber had several run-ins with the law around the world before his first arrest in 2014,[358] including when he was accused of reckless driving in his neighbourhood in 2012, and charged in Brazil with vandalism in 2013.[358][359] One of his neighbours in Calabasas, California, accused Bieber of throwing eggs at his home on January 9, 2014, and causing thousands of dollars of damage.[358][360][361] On January 23, 2014, Bieber was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, together with singer Khalil, on suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI), driving with an over six month expired license, and resisting arrest without violence.[359][362][363] Police said that Bieber told authorities he had consumed alcohol, smoked marijuana, and taken prescription drugs.[358] He was released from these charges on a $2,500 bond.[364] A toxicology report revealed that Bieber had THC (a principal constituent of cannabis) and the anti-anxiety medication Xanax in his system at the time of his arrest.[365][366] However, in January 2021, he reflected on this event, describing it as \"not [his] finest hour\" and encouraging fans to \"let the forgiveness of Jesus take over and watch your life blossom into all that God has designed you to be.\"[367]\n\nBieber's January 2014 mugshot, after being detained by police in Miami Beach, Florida\n\nFollowing Bieber's arrest on the DUI charge, more than 270,000 people petitioned the White House seeking to have him deported from the United States. Although the number of signatures received was sufficient to require a response under published White House guidelines, the Obama Administration declined substantive comment on the petition.[368] Immigration Law expert Harlan York noted that the likelihood of Bieber being deported was extremely slim. York stated, \"About a decade ago, the Supreme Court ruled that driving under the influence, typically, is not a basis to deport someone.\"[369]\n\nIn April 2013, Bieber was criticized for writing a message in the guestbook at the Anne Frank House which read, \"Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.\"[370] After the message was posted on the museum's Facebook page, Bieber received widespread criticism on social media for perceived insensitivity and narcissism. The Anne Frank House defended Bieber, stating, \"He's 19. It's a crazy life he's living, he didn't mean bad [...] He was very interested in the story of Anne Frank and stayed for over an hour. We hope that his visit will inspire his fans to learn more about her life and hopefully read the diary.\"[371][372]\n\nOn July 9, 2014, Bieber was charged with one misdemeanour count of vandalism in California for throwing eggs at his Calabasas neighbour's home in January.[361][373][374] Police earlier claimed that they had video footage of him high-fiving friends after the eggs were thrown.[361][375] With him pleading no contest to the charge, the Los Angeles County Superior Court sentenced him on July 9 to pay $80,900 in restitution, serve two years' probation, complete 12 weeks of anger management, and five days of community service in what the district attorney termed a negotiated settlement. Since then, he has permanently moved to Beverly Hills, California.[361][373][374]\n\nOn August 13, 2014, the January DUI case was settled with a plea bargain; Bieber pleaded guilty to resisting an officer without violence and a lesser charge of driving without due care and attention. He was fined US$500 and sentenced to attend a 12-hour anger management course and a program that teaches the impact of drunken driving on victims. As part of the plea bargain, he made a US$50,000 contribution to Our Kids, a local children's charity.[376][377]\n\nI didn't want to come off arrogant or conceited, or basically how I've been acting the past year, year and a half ... although what's happened in the past has happened, I just want to ... be kind and loving and gentle and soft. \u2014Bieber reflects in a video posted in January 2015[378]\n\nOn September 1, 2014, Bieber was arrested and charged with assault and dangerous driving near his hometown of Stratford, Ontario, after a collision between a minivan and Bieber's all-terrain vehicle on August 29. Ontario police said that he then \"engaged in a physical altercation\" with an occupant of the minivan. He was released shortly and his lawyer blamed the incident on \"the unwelcome presence of paparazzi\".[379][380] On September 8, Toronto dropped an assault charge against him originally brought up on January 29 for an incident with a limousine driver in December 2013.[381][382] In November 2014, he was ordered to appear in Argentina within 60 days by a Buenos Aires court to give testimony on an alleged assault on a photographer on November 9, 2013.[383] When he failed to do so, an arrest warrant was issued and two of his bodyguards were released in Argentina in April 2015.[384]\n\nIn June 2014, a video emerged of a 15-year-old Bieber telling a joke about black people, which used the word \"nigger\" multiple times.[385] In the same month, a second video showed a 15-year-old Bieber giggling as he croons his song \"One Less Lonely Girl\", but parodying the main lyric as \"One less lonely nigger\", and stating that if he were to kill one, he would be \"part of the KKK\".[386][387] He apologized the day the latter was released: \"Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I've ever dealt with.\"[388]\n\nIn July 2017, the Chinese government banned Bieber from performing in China. A Chinese Bieber fan contacted the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture requesting the reason for the ban. The Bureau released a statement, explaining \"Justin Bieber is a gifted singer, but he is also a controversial young foreign singer\", and \"In order to maintain order in the Chinese market and purify the Chinese performance environment, it is not suitable to bring in badly behaved entertainers.\"[389][390] In 2021, Chinese streaming sites Youku, iQIYI, and Tencent Video removed Bieber's scenes in Friends: The Reunion donning Ross Geller's iconic \"Spudnik\" costume.[391]\n\nIn June 2020, Bieber was accused of sexual assault by an anonymous woman, merely known as \"Danielle\", who claimed on Twitter that the singer had made non-consensual sexual acts at a Four Seasons hotel in Austin, Texas in March 2014 while with then-girlfriend Selena Gomez.[392] The woman claimed that she had been inspired to tell her story by Twitter user 'itsgabby', who had accused actor Ansel Elgort of sexual assault the week prior.[393] In a series of tweets Bieber denied all the allegations, stating that sexual abuse \"is something I don't take lightly\". He provided proof that he was not present in the location within the time that the alleged incident took place, dismissing all allegations.[394]\n\nHealth\n\nBieber has struggled with mental health issues,[395] particularly depression and anxiety,[396][397] at various points during his career.[398] He has generally been open about these issues.[399][400]\n\nOn January 8, 2020, Bieber announced on his Instagram that he had been diagnosed with Lyme disease. He also revealed that he has infectious mononucleosis, which affected his neurological and overall health.[401]\n\nOn February 3, 2020, in Bieber\u2019s American YouTube docu-series Seasons, the singer opened up about his struggles with addiction with frequent consumption of lean, pills of MDMA and hallucinogenic mushrooms in early stages of his career. [402]\n\nOn February 20, 2022, it was reported that Bieber had tested positive for COVID-19, two days after embarking on his fourth concert tour, Justice World Tour.[403]\n\nAchievements\n\nThroughout his career, Bieber has sold an estimated 150 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[404][405]\n\nIn 2011, Bieber was honoured with a star in front of Avon Theater in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, where he used to busk when he was younger. On November 23, 2012, Bieber was presented with the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal by the former Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper. He was one of 60,000 Canadians to receive the Diamond Jubilee medal that year.[406] In 2013, Bieber received a Diamond award from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for his single \"Baby\", which at the time became the highest-certified digital single of all time.[407][408] Bieber is credited with three Diamond Certified singles from the RIAA for \"Baby\", \"Sorry\", and \"Despacito\". Bieber has won two Grammy Awards out of 22 nominations,[409] one Latin Grammy Award,[14] two Brit Awards,[410][411] 21 Billboard Music Awards,[412] and numerous fan voted accolades which include 18 American Music Awards,[413] 23 Teen Choice Awards (the most wins for a male individual),[414] six iHeartRadio Music Awards, and six MTV Video Music Awards. He has also won a record 21 MTV Europe Music Awards (the most wins for any artist in history), including one special award.[415]\n\nIn 2015, Bieber released \"Where Are \u00dc Now\" with Jack \u00dc, which is widely regarded as one of the \"biggest dance music crossover hits\" of the 2010s, and is said to have influenced the \"direction of contemporary pop music\".[416] On September 19, 2015, Bieber became the youngest (21) solo male artist to debut at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100.[138] Following the release of his fourth studio album Purpose, Bieber set major milestones globally. He became the first artist, since Elvis Presley in 2005, to replace his own song as number one on the UK Singles Chart.[417] He is the first artist in history to occupy the entire top three of the UK Singles Chart. He achieved this feat as \"Love Yourself\", \"Sorry\" and \"What Do You Mean?\" charted at positions 1, 2 and 3 simultaneously.[11] The singles also peaked at number one in the US, making Bieber the first male artist since Justin Timberlake in 2007 to have three number-ones from an album.[141] He also became the first solo artist to chart three solo songs in the top five of the US Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously, and the first as a lead act since the Beatles in 1964.[142] \"Love Yourself\" topped Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 Chart in 2016, followed by \"Sorry\" at number two, and made Bieber only the third artist in history to hold the top-two positions of the Billboard Year-End Hot 100, after the Beatles in 1964 and Usher in 2004.[143] As of 2021, Bieber has set 32 Guinness World Records, which include eight that were achieved from the success of his album Purpose and was featured in the 2017 Edition. These records included the most streamed track on Spotify in one week, the most streamed album on Spotify in one week, the most simultaneous tracks on the US Billboard Hot 100, and the most simultaneous new entries on the US Billboard Hot 100 by a solo artist, among others.[418]\n\nIn 2017, Bieber became the first artist in history to chart new number-one singles in consecutive weeks.[167] His remix to Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee's \"Despacito\" reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 a week after DJ Khaled's \"I'm the One\" debuted at number one, both songs on which he is a featured artist.[419] \"Despacito\" became a global success and has been widely credited by music journalists as being instrumental in popularizing Latin pop music in the mainstream market again.[420] It tied the then-record for the most weeks at number one in US Billboard Hot 100 history. The song is the most streamed track worldwide.[421] Billboard ranked \"Despacito\" at number one on the Greatest of All Time Hot Latin Songs and number five on the Greatest of All Time Songs of the Summer Charts respectively.[13][165]\n\nIn 2018, \"Steps to Stardom\", an exhibit on Bieber's early career, opened in his hometown of Stratford, Ontario at the Stratford Perth Museum, offering a collection of mementoes from his formative years and rise to international stardom.[422] The items on display include a professional drum kit he owned as a younger child, his Grammy Award, microphones, his Stratford Warriors hockey jacket, and personal letters, including one from Michelle Obama.[422] Bieber made a number of visits to the museum.[423][424] \"Steps to Stardom\" was originally scheduled to close in October 2018 but the board of the museum extended its stay for at least another year after the exhibit broke attendance records set by its Anne Frank House exhibit in 2015.[425]\n\nIn 2019, Bieber became the youngest (25) solo male artist to spend 200 cumulative weeks in the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100.[183] In 2021, Bieber's sixth studio album Justice and the fifth single from the album, \"Peaches\", simultaneously debuted at number one on both the US Billboard 200 and the US Billboard Hot 100 Charts respectively, making Bieber the first solo male artist in history to do so.[202] He also became the first solo male artist to top the US Billboard Hot 100, Billboard Global 200, and Billboard Global 200 Excl.
