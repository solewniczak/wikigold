The helmer of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films has a lifetime total of approximately $6,502.7 billion, followed by Transformers\u2018 Michael Bay ($6.451 billion), Avatar\u2018s James Cameron ($6.139 billion), and Harry Potter\u2018s David Yates ($5.347 billion).\n\nThe original Jurassic Park is still Spielberg\u2019s biggest commercial success with $983.8 million (not adjusted for inflation). Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (despite the many skeptics it garnered) comes in second with $786.6 million, and E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial comes in third with $717 million.\n\nIn the past year alone, Spielberg took a quick detour from post-production on Ready Player One to direct a little Oscar contender you might know as The Post, and there\u2019s plenty more on the director\u2019s docket in the months ahead. With a West Side Story remake and another Indiana Jones in the works, might he leap over another box office hurdle?", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F03%2Fgettyimages-914618346-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F12%2F13%2FMost-Anticipated-Books.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2F2022-Tours.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F04%2F09%2Fnick-romano-image.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F03%2Fgettyimages-914618346-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F2022-Premiere-Dates.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F03%2Fgettyimages-914618346-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Romano", "April", "At Am Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/17/steven-spielberg-movies-10-billion-box-office/", "title": "Steven Spielberg becomes first director to cross $10 billion at worldwide box office", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Wea International", "news_keywords": "Wea International", "description": "Just a typical day for the most commercially successful filmmaker.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Steven Spielberg becomes first director to cross $10 billion at worldwide box office", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/17/steven-spielberg-movies-10-billion-box-office/", "description": "Just a typical day for the most commercially successful filmmaker.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F03%2Fgettyimages-914618346-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/17/steven-spielberg-movies-10-billion-box-office/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F03%2Fgettyimages-914618346-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/17/steven-spielberg-movies-10-billion-box-office/", "title": "Steven Spielberg becomes first director to cross $10 billion at worldwide box office", "description": "Just a typical day for the most commercially successful filmmaker.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F03%2Fgettyimages-914618346-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/17/steven-spielberg-movies-10-billion-box-office/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523916000.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
