On Wednesday, director Patty Jenkins and star Gal Gadot both released stills from the upcoming movie, which will be titled, drum roll . . . Wonder Woman 1984, because the film is set during the Cold War. We\u2019ll get to that in a minute. But first, let\u2019s address the biggest reveal from these new stills: Steve Trevor is alive!\n\nJenkins shared a still of Chris Pine reprising his role as Trevor with this caption: \u201cWelcome to WONDER WOMAN 1984, Steve Trevor! #WW84.\u201d Let it be known that Pine is absolutely working the hell out of that 1980s-inspired wardrobe, wearing an all-black jumpsuit and a pair of worn-in Nike Cortez sneakers. We\u2019ve also got to give it up to the perfectly dressed extras around him, bringing a full 80s mall fantasy to life. Armie Hammer is going to take one look at this still and un-retire his jumpsuit phase.\n\nBut now for a more pressing question: how, exactly, is Steve Trevor alive? As you might recall, the first Wonder Woman introduced Trevor as an American spy who teams up with Diana during the first World War. They fall in love, but then Trevor rides off on a heroic suicide mission, sacrificing his life in order to prevent a deadly gas from being used in the war. Considering how popular his character was, Warner Bros. brass probably decided Trevor was too handsome and pure to leave behind for the sequel\u2014implausible though his survival may be.\n\nThere are numerous ways Trevor could be brought back for the sequel, per the limitless rules of the comic-book world. Trevor could return as an alternate version of himself\u2014maybe from another dimension?\u2014or maybe he was saved from his original fate through a time jump, as comicbook.com surmises. And as The Hollywood Reporter notes, there are already inconsistencies with Trevor\u2019s timeline in the Wonder Woman comics, due to sporadic relaunches and reboots of the franchise\u2014so there are plenty of possible story lines for Jenkins to borrow for the sequel.\n\nGadot\u2019s Wonder Woman 1984 reveal, meanwhile, was a bit on the simpler side: just a still of Diana Prince standing in front of an ominous number of TV screens.\n\nHer outfit\u2014what we can see of it, anyway\u2013appears much less retro than Trevor\u2019s, which is probably for the best. Do we want to see Diana Prince in massive shoulder pads? Maybe; maybe not.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a980aa49028ff3af11a19a6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kristen-wiig-wonder-woman-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aff0cb75ffad5416e1cbddd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Zazie-Beats-Deadpool-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a551eb820377b13ab2ea517/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-900974568.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b1db2016cf0c55cfe0c40f6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Tonys-2018-Red-Carpet-SS10.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b1da811ef9c7776eebc667c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Tonys-2018-Red-Carpet-SS01.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b212bfaa84e0e7a3df09844/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Chris-Pine-Wonder-Woman.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b212bfaa84e0e7a3df09844/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Chris-Pine-Wonder-Woman.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b1dae97f47a36695449cb49/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Tonys-2018-Red-Carpet-SS08.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b212bfaa84e0e7a3df09844/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Chris-Pine-Wonder-Woman.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Yohana Desta", "Nora Maloney"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/wonder-woman-1984-first-look-chris-pine-steve-trevor", "title": "Wonder Woman 1984 First Look: How Is Steve Trevor Alive?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Director Patty Jenkins and star Gal Gadot have shared intriguing images from the upcoming Wonder Woman sequel, which takes place in 1984.", "id": "5b2117b8ef9c7776eebc66d3", "keywords": "wonder woman,patty jenkins,gal gadot,warner bros,chris pine", "news_keywords": "wonder woman,patty jenkins,gal gadot,warner bros,chris pine", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b2117b8ef9c7776eebc66d3", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Director Patty Jenkins and star Gal Gadot have shared intriguing images from the upcoming Wonder Woman sequel, which takes place in 1984.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b212bfaa84e0e7a3df09844/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Chris-Pine-Wonder-Woman.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b212bfaa84e0e7a3df09844/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Chris-Pine-Wonder-Woman.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Director Patty Jenkins and star Gal Gadot have shared intriguing images from the upcoming Wonder Woman sequel, which takes place in 1984.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b212bfaa84e0e7a3df09844/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Chris-Pine-Wonder-Woman.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Wonder Woman 1984 First Look: How Is Steve Trevor Alive?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/wonder-woman-1984-first-look-chris-pine-steve-trevor"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-06-13T14:37:11.568Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b212bfaa84e0e7a3df09844/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Chris-Pine-Wonder-Woman.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528900631.568, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
