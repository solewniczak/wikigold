In our four-year history of working together on this incredible show, these accusations have NEVER been revealed or discussed directly with me or anyone at Amazon. Therefore, I can only surmise that the investigation against me was deeply flawed and biased toward the toxic politicized atmosphere that afflicted our set,\u201d he added.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Amber Tamblyn Defends Husband David Cross Amid Allegation of Racism: \u2018He Said He Was Sorry\u2019\n\nHe continued, \u201cAs I have consistently stated, I deeply regret if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone and I will continue to vehemently defend myself. I also deeply regret that this ground-breaking show, which changed so many lives, is now in jeopardy. That, to me, is the biggest heartbreak.\u201d\n\nThe same day Amazon parted ways with Tambor, Soloway spoke of her \u201crespect and admiration\u201d for Tambor\u2019s accusers.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fjeffrey-tambor-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1067&h=534&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fjeffrey-tambor-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1067&h=534&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fjeffrey-tambor-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "February"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/david-cross-supports-jeffrey-tambor/", "title": "David Cross Supports Arrested Development Costar Jeffrey Tambor Amid Sexual Harassment Claims", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Jeffrey Tambor,News", "news_keywords": "Jeffrey Tambor,News", "description": "\"I can't speak for everybody, I know there are a number of us who stand behind him,\" David Cross said while speaking out in support of Jeffrey Tambor", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "David Cross Supports Arrested Development Costar Jeffrey Tambor Amid Sexual Harassment Claims", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/david-cross-supports-jeffrey-tambor/", "description": "\"I can't speak for everybody, I know there are a number of us who stand behind him,\" David Cross said while speaking out in support of Jeffrey Tambor", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1067&h=534&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fjeffrey-tambor-1.jpg", "width": 1067, "height": 534}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/david-cross-supports-jeffrey-tambor/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fjeffrey-tambor-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/david-cross-supports-jeffrey-tambor/", "title": "David Cross Supports Arrested Development Costar Jeffrey Tambor Amid Sexual Harassment Claims", "description": "\"I can't speak for everybody, I know there are a number of us who stand behind him,\" David Cross said while speaking out in support of Jeffrey Tambor", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1067&h=534&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fjeffrey-tambor-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/tv/david-cross-supports-jeffrey-tambor/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
