They are just that: quick and not sustainable. In fact, they may end up affecting how you manage your weight long term.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not sensible to eliminate whole food groups or make drastic dietary changes which are not sustainable \u2014 you may end up deficient in micronutrients and lacking important dietary diversity which aid gut bacteria,\u201d she continued, later pointing out that \u201csome gluten-free products are actually worse than the original item itself as they tend to have added ingredients owed to the lack of the protein gluten.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Gwyneth Paltrow Says She\u2019s Moving Away from Acting to Focus on Goop: \u2018This Really Requires Almost All of My Time\u2019\n\nBut the backlash didn\u2019t scare Goop. \u201cWe would never advocate for an unhealthy diet or extreme routine,\u201d a representative for the company told E! News. \u201cAs Tracy said in the interview, you should make choices based on what is best for your individual body.\u201d\n\nAnderson\u2019s spokesperson also stood by her words, telling E! News: \u201cOver the course of her 20-year career, Tracy has consistently practiced owning a 1-2 lb. weight loss per week when someone has unhealthy weight to lose. Owning a 1-2 lb. weight loss per week is different than simply dropping 1-2 lbs. per week, which causes people to hold onto unhealthy weight. Of the 14 lbs. that someone could effectively lose in a month \u2014 if they have excess weight on them \u2014 the goal is to own 8 lbs. of that, which is aligned with Tracy\u2019s practice of not living on extreme diets.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F18%2F248515971_423792849226570_1672372709981615183_n.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fbfa_22704_2729020-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fgwyneth-paltrow2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fbillie-eilish.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F11%2F22%2FMGK.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftammy-duckworth-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fgwyneth-paltrow2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F08%2F03%2Frobin-roberts-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F12%2F02%2Frita-moreno-marlon-brando-elvis-presley.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2021%2F06%2F03%2Fdemi-lovato.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fgwyneth-paltrow2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn", "December"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/health/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-tracy-anderson-damaging-diet/", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Stands By Tracy Anderson's Potentially 'Damaging' Extreme Diet", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Bodies,Gwyneth Paltrow,News,Tracy Anderson", "news_keywords": "Bodies,Gwyneth Paltrow,News,Tracy Anderson", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop is biting back at critics who claim the company endorsed a potentially harmful extreme diet", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Stands By Tracy Anderson's Potentially 'Damaging' Extreme Diet", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/health/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-tracy-anderson-damaging-diet/", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop is biting back at critics who claim the company endorsed a potentially harmful extreme diet", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fgwyneth-paltrow2.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/health/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-tracy-anderson-damaging-diet/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fgwyneth-paltrow2.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/health/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-tracy-anderson-damaging-diet/", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Stands By Tracy Anderson's Potentially 'Damaging' Extreme Diet", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop is biting back at critics who claim the company endorsed a potentially harmful extreme diet", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fgwyneth-paltrow2.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}, "url": "https://people.com/health/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-tracy-anderson-damaging-diet/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
