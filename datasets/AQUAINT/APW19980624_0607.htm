<p> [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] have signed a deal that Iraq says will resolve their longstanding dispute over [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. </p> 
<p> The agreement was reached following a week of talks in [[Baghdad]] between senior Iraqi officials and a visiting Iranian delegation headed by Abdullah al-Najafi, head of Iran's POW commission, the official [[National Iraqi News Agency|Iraqi News Agency|0.2]] reported Wednesday. </p> 
<p> But the agency gave no further details and al-Najafi, who left Baghdad on Wednesday, declined to comment. </p> 
<p> Al-Najafi arrived in Baghdad last week with a list of thousands of Iranian POWs [[Tehran|Tehran|0.4]] claims are still held by Iraq. </p> 
<p> Iraq has long maintained that it has released all Iranian prisoners and was reportedly angered by the new list. </p> 
<p> In April, Iran released 5,584 Iraqi POWs and Iraq freed three POWs and 316 Iranians it classified as civil law detainees. </p> 
<p> It was the largest [[Repatriation|repatriation|0.2]] of Iranian and Iraqi POWs since 1990, said the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], which supervised the swap. The Red Cross says it knows of several thousand Iraqis in Iran, but it is not aware of more Iranian POWs in Iraq. </p> 
<p> The [[Iran-Iraq war]], in which more than more than 1 million people were killed or wounded, ended in 1988. </p> 
<p> The issue of POWs has long stood in the way of better ties. </p> </body> </html>
