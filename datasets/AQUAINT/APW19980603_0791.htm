<p> MORE and more people are dying or suffering from fatal diseases such as [[Brain tumor|brain tumours]], mammarian or [[breast cancer]] and brain [[Bleeding|haemorrhage]] due to a lack of proper medical care.However, things may change as the Srisiam Hospital in [[Bangkok|Bangkok|0.6]] has now established the first ever [[Radiosurgery|Radio Surgery|1.0]] Institute in [[Thailand|Thailand|0.4]] -- (there are presently more than 100 radio surgery centres around the world). </p> 
<p> Radio surgery is a modern technique which doesn't require surgery in order to remove [[Cancer|cancerous|0.2]] growth or [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. It involves a [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensional|0.2]] method known as [[Stereotactic surgery|Stereotaxic Surgery|0.6]], which is also used in conjunction with [[Radiation|radiation|0.2]] equipment known as the [[Linear particle accelerator|Linear Accelerator|0.8]]. </p> 
<p> With this new technology, doctors are able to removal cancerous tissues embedded deep inside the brain or near sensitive organs that makes normal surgery very difficult and risky. With radio surgery, every step is controlled by computers and patients are [[Consciousness|conscious|0.2]] while they undergo treatment. </p> 
<p> This new technique is also capable of treating diseases such as Artero Venous [[Congenital disorder|Malformation]] (the [[Coagulation|clotting]] of veins or blood [[Capillary|capillaries]] in the brain).So far, ninety per cent of the radio surgery treatments have been successful and patients only have to remain in hospital for three days. Additionally, there is no need for patients to shave their heads and radio surgery causes no scar, little blood loss and is not expensive.For more information contact the hospital at srisiam ksc.th.com. </p> </body> </html>
