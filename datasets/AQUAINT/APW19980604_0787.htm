<p> [[Mechai Viravaidya|Viravaidya|0.6]]'s plan to set up a watchdog company to monitor [[SET Index|SET|0.2]]-listed companies and expose possible abuses of [[Business ethics|corporate ethics|0.6]]. I agree with him whole-heartedly and would like to know where to mail my checks to subscribe to the company's shares. Could you advise? </p> 
<p> Also, I fully support his request for the media to report on the [[Lifestyle|lifestyle|0.2]] of former [[Chief executive officer|executives|0.2]] of the failed [[Bank|banks|0.4]] and [[Finance|finance|0.2]] companies. We all know too well that these people will not be punished legally because of the inefficiency of the [[Bank of Thailand|Bank of Thailand|0.8]] in collecting evidence against them and of our [[Legal systems of the world|justice system|0.2]] in delivering timely justice. It is the media's job to discover how these guys are better off after destroying our country, and it is the [[Thai people]]'s job to socially punish them. </p> 
<p> I would like to propose that [[Newspaper|newspapers|0.2]] and [[Television channel|TV stations|0.2]] play up this issue (the continued luxurious lifestyle of the former executives) to attract more public attention, and I will give them Bt20,000 of my hard-earned salary with my full blessing. </p> 
<p> Artit Krichphiphat (An ordinary Thai citizen who wants to see the right things get done) Editor's note: Khun Mechai will organise a seminar on the plan on June 7 at the Telephone Organisation of Thailand at 10 am. The media already has the duty to cover such issues without additional financial reward. </p> </body> </html>
